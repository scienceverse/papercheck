This means that the study did not include enough participants to reliably detect a realistic effect size (see Table 1 for a definition of key terms). One method to avoid low statistical power is to calculate how many participants you need for a given effect size in a process called ""power analysis"". Power analysis is not the only way to justify your sample size (see Lakens, 2022), but despite increased attention to statistical power, it is still rare to find articles that justified their sample size through power analysis (Chen & Liu, 2019;Guo et al., 2014;Larson & Carbine, 2017). Even for those that do report a power analysis, there are often other problems such as poor justification for the effect size, misunderstanding statistical power, or not making the power analysis reproducible (Bakker et al., 2020;Beribisky et al., 2019;Collins & Watt, 2021).

As the rejection region is one 5% area (instead of two 2.5% areas), the critical value is smaller, so holding everything else constant, you need fewer participants for a statistically significant result. One-tailed tests also offer a more severe test of a hypothesis since the observed result must reach the rejection region in the hypothesised direction.

However, there are some limitations to the current study. First, the measurement tools need to be further improved. This study adopts the recall method to measure the parenting style of college students, and the absence of instructions to participants about which period of parenting they should recall is a limitation. This may be due to the lack of explicit inquiry in the original scale regarding the specific period of growth experience recalled by participants. The limitations of recalling parenting styles have been discussed in previous studies (Rothrauff et al., 2009). One study noted that retrospective measurements ""may constitute valid indicators of the individual's current perception of those features, and as such, may be useful in understanding psychological development or adjustment"" (Henry et al., 1994). While this may be a challenge that cannot be resolved at the present stage, future studies will strive to employ diversified measures by integrating subjective reports from both parents and children when assessing parenting style. Secondly, the representativeness of the sample needs to be further improved. Future studies could further expand the sample size, use more scientific methods to calculate the sample size (Lakens, 2022;Schoemann et al., 2017), and adopt stratified sampling for participant recruitment. Given that participants in this study were from the same university, the applicability of the results of this survey needs to be further verified. Readers need to be cautious if they plan to generalize the results of the survey outside the survey institution. In addition, there are limitations in conducting cross-sectional studies with college students as participants.

This was the correlational analysis of the association between ACT interpretation bias scores and the mental health-related self-report measures of personality and well-being, used to evaluate association with mental-health related measures. For this, sample size calculations were based on a smallest effect size of interest (Lakens, 2022;Lakens et al., 2018). For the specific research question at hand, there is little previous research that would suggest effect sizes to be expected, and the few previous findings that have been reported (see Introduction) are probably not suitable for deriving reliable estimates of effect sizes due to the small samples in which they were obtained. From other studies in other domains of psychology, we know that correlations between implicit behavioral measures (as acquired in the ACT) and explicit self-report measures (as assessed with questionnaires) are typically rather small, rarely exceed effect sizes of r = .25, and are often considerably lower (Mischel, 1968;Bernoster et al., 2019;Bosco et al., 2015). We therefore wanted to ensure that we could detect correlations well below .25 with decent statistical power. On the other hand, very small correlations close to zero did not appear to be of theoretical interest to us. Taking these two aspects into account, we defined .15 as the smallest effect size of interest for this study. For this smallest effect size of interest, sample size calculations suggested a sample size of N = 345 to be necessary to detect correlations of r ≥ .15 with 80% power at a p level of .05 in two-sided tests (R package pwr; Champely, 2020).","The following text is part of a scientific article.

First, all collateral measures were based on parent report and the perspectives of the children were not able to be captured due to the developmental and communicative level of all participants. Parents may have perceived and/or reported improvements in other areas as a reflection of improved sleep; a Halo effect (Hunter et al., 2020;McLay et al., 2022b). In addition, parents were aware of the rationale for administering the collateral effect measures and in turn may have responded in a socially desirable manner. To prevent potential biases influencing results, future research should obtain data from additional sources for triangulation. Second, while the psychometric properties of the selected measures were good, it is possible some were not sensitive enough to detect small changes (e.g., the RQI has only 5 broad items). In addition, although most have been used extensively with children with neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g., Glasson et al., 2020;McLay et al., 2022b), some (e.g., CBCL 5-18 years) have not been validated with this population, and thus may have compromised reliability and validity. Observational data would ensure small and specific changes were captured and validated (e.g., Cohen et al., 2018). Third, although this study administered a range of collateral effect measures, sleep difficulties can negatively impact a wide range of areas of functioning (e.g., childrens' cognitive functioning, school attendance and communication, and parents' child-related stress and perceived control) that were not measured. Fourth, although the inclusion of a range of RGNC provided an adequate sample size for formal quantitative evaluation (Lakens, 2022), RGNC are a heterogenous group of conditions with varying presentations. We know the etiology of sleep difficulties and the child and parent variables assessed are multifaceted, and the direction of the relationship varies. Therefore, the degree to which children and families studied here are representative of the range of children with RGNC is unknown, as is the generality of intervention effects. Finally, although these results are promising, it is not possible to determine whether changes in sleep and/or the strategies taught in behavioral sleep intervention directly resulted in all the collateral benefits reported. The intervention duration for some participants was prolonged (maximum = 210 nights), and thus so was the time between completion of pre-and post-intervention measures. It is possible change could have occurred without intervention, at least in some cases and particularly for young children in sensitive developmental periods. In future research, comparison to a waitlist control group would clarify if the magnitude of change was greater for those who received a behavioral sleep intervention. On the other hand, for those who had shorter intervention periods (minimum = 29 nights), collateral effects might not yet have had time to emerge. The duration of any collateral benefits is also important, and future research should consider administering collateral measures during follow-up periods, to determine the maintenance of collateral effects or whether collateral effects emerge later (McLay et al., 2022b).","The following text is part of a scientific article.

Practitioners, such as teachers or therapists, who may wish to conduct investigations to analyse and improve their practice, are likely to be working with small samples. In such instances, the use of quantitative measures is sometimes seen as unlikely to provide reliable results (Lakens, 2022;McCarthy, Whittaker, Boyle, & Eyal, 2017) and may also elicit data that feels impersonal and fails to give insights into the lives of individuals or groups being investigated. Some researchers, Houts, Edwards, Wirth, and Deal (2016) rightly propose that the development of some quantitative techniques, such as the use of Rasch Analysis, can have benefits even when applied to samples of li mited size, but acknowledge that many quantitative measures deployed with such samples are limited. Cox (2012) recognised that many novice researchers come from a professional background and have the experience and opportunity to conduct investigations that could influence the development of practice. However, she suggested that the dominance of quantitative methods often acts as a constraint on those practitioners who might otherwise engage with research. She further argues that while policymakers appear to depend upon the numerical data more commonly associated with quantitative data when making a case for change or the implementation of new policies, the importance of understanding the specific needs of groups, such as those with disabilities, emphasises the strength of qualitative approaches. While both she and the authors of this paper readily acknowledge the value of quantitative studies and recognise that in some instances a mixed-methods approach may have greater currency, it is suggested that qualitative research is more likely to reveal the lived experiences of those for whom policymakers see the need to bring about change. This was certainly a view endorsed by those who attended the training reported in this article. Cook and Cook (2016) stress the importance of recognising qualitative research as an umbrella term that incorporates many approaches to investigation. One of the greatest advantages of qualitative research that they perceive is the ability to provide in-depth descriptions of the phenomena being investigated. These authors emphasise that qualitative research is not an alternative to other methodologies but needs to be applied in situations that benefit from the descriptive detail needed to aid understanding of a phenomenon. It is important to recognise that qualitative studies might, as in the case of the work reported in this paper, identify the effectiveness of instruction but that they cannot eliminate the fact that other methods of delivery might be equally effective. Only experimental research can determine these factors. However, the ethical challenges of conducting experimental research in these circumstances may present problems with respect to the intentions of tutors to deliver training in a manner that is equitable and does not put a group at a disadvantage.","The following text is part of a scientific article.

With a medium effect size of .50 for our study, a level of significance set at α = .05, and a study power set at 80%, 34 participants were required to conduct the intervention study (50). Because this represented the minimum sample size needed, 53 WMs were asked via mail to participate in this second study. Participants were recruited for the online intervention if they met the following criteria: (1) had returned to work after maternity leave; (2) had at least one child (newborn-6 years old). These criteria are in line with the main aim of the study (i.e., to examine women's experiences of returning to work after maternity leave). It is well established in many countries that the burden of care shortly after birth and in general, is especially high for mothers compared to fathers. Furthermore, there are few resources and accessibility to high-quality childcare in Italy, making it challenging for parents to find infant care after the birth of an infant. Thirty-four of those 53 responded to the email and agreed to participate. All participants were Italian WMs living in an urban area of northern Italy. Most participants were between 31 and 40 years old (67.6%), 23.5% were over 41, and some were between 18 and 30 (8.8%). Almost all were employed in paid work (97.1%), while one was a freelancer (2.9%). The majority had an open-ended contract (91.2%), whereas the rest had a fixed-term contract (8.8%). Seventy-six point five percent of participants worked full-time, 23.5% part-time. Specifically, almost a third of the WMs (32.2%) worked as healthcare professionals (i.e., 25% nurse; 3.6% The majority of participants (92.9%) were married or cohabiting, while 7.1% were divorced or separated. Half of the WMs participating in the study had two children (50%), 35.3% had one, and 14.7% had three or more. Participants were asked who generally takes care of their child in times of need. More than a third of the participants ask their parents for help (39.3%); 32.1% ask their partner for help; 14.3% prefer to hire a babysitter; 10.8% ask for help from other family members (e.g., aunt, grandparents, in-laws); 3.6% ask for help from local services (e.g., nursery schools). All participants were duly informed that participation was anonymous and voluntary. Although 34 WMs were initially recruited, the final group consisted of 28 participants, which was due mostly to mother's own health concerns, the health of their children, or their workload (Figure 2).

The relationship between sample size and p-values is crucial to statistical analysis [56,57]. As the sample size increases, statistical tests become more sensitive to detecting differences or effects. This increased sensitivity can be attributed to the reduction in sampling variability, leading to more precise estimates of population parameters. Also, effect size matters because a larger sample size could be needed to achieve statistical significance in situations where the effect size is small [58,59]. Another consideration regarding sample size involves the issue that a larger sample size might reduce the risk of Type II errors (false negatives), as the increased power improves the ability to detect true effects, but researchers should be cautious about the increased risk of Type I errors (false positives) when interpreting small p-values [60]. In this situation, the clinical or practical significance of the findings should be considered. Non-parametric or noncentral t-distributions could indeed be employed in case of violation of normality when dealing with few samples; however, the significance computed through a t-test is still commonly used because the Welch t-test or rank transformation before running a t-test might pose other challenges when dealing with small samples (reduced statistical power or increased false positives) [27]. The analysis sequence proposed in the current study could support researchers in identifying proteins that are not completely detected by statistics in situations where only a few data are available. A restricted number of samples not only affects p-values but also the correct identification of the confidence intervals or the reproducibility of the experimental results, which has already been observed in the literature [20,27,61,62]. However, increasing the sample size might only sometimes be possible. Working with human cells, especially primary ones, can be resource-intensive in terms of time and resources; using a smaller number of samples can help streamline experiments, making them more manageable within budgetary and time constraints [63]. With few samples, it may be easier to maintain consistent conditions across experiments and design experiments that directly test biological hypotheses without unnecessary complexity. Considering that using a limited number of samples, including three, is a common practice, new tools for analyzing and interpreting the results might help researchers support their findings. The proposed analysis pipeline evaluates donors' cell profiles without assuming any distribution. Another aspect to consider when working on data from few donors relates to the variability in the findings: biological variability between different cultures can be substantial. One could assume that with few samples, the inherent experimental variability might be reduced, making it easier to detect experimental effects. However, this might only be true sometimes, and high variability in a few sample experiments might pose challenges and affect the convertibility of the outcomes to the human population. The current study provides further evidence on a dataset under investigation because descriptive ML-based analysis on actual data might support statistical inference or help researchers focus their attention on specific results, being more careful in interpreting the outcomes.","The following text is part of a scientific article.

Researchers might have been unaware about such benchmarks.

For instance, if a lineup procedure has no costs (e.g., provide a minor instruction to focus on eyes before the lineup) but leads to an improved AUC (compared to the lineup without such instruction), even if relatively small, might already be good enough. 5 On the other hand, if the procedure is very costly or difficult (e.g., construct a 16 person versus 6 person fair lineup), greater differences in the ROC curves and AUC values might be warranted. However, only 15 AUC values from two studies were interpreted in light of the context of the study 6 which makes it unlikely that most researchers were aware of the importance of contextualizing their findings to understand the magnitude or meaningfulness of the results.","The following text is part of a scientific article.

That is, using the 95% CI, it can be established whether an observed finding is too small to care about (i.e., 95% CI is smaller than the SESOI), practically meaningful (95% CI is greater than the SESOI; Westlake, 1972), or to understand the uncertainty around the estimates (relatively large 95% CIs). In our study, less than half of the studies (= 44.1%) provided 95% CIs alongside the reported AUC values. However, when 95% CIs were reported, it was for the AUC value while 95% CIs along the ROC curves were never reported. However, it is possible to plot such 95% CIs for the entire ROC curve via ""pROC"" in R and we recommend researchers to do so (for an example see Figure 8 and R code on <https://osf.io/dgxsz/>). The visualization of the ROC curve and its 95% CIs is crucial to see whether ROC curves overlap. Specifically, if two ROC curves overlap (see Figure 3), AUC values become less informative and alternative or local (at individual thresholds) tests need to be performed (for alternative analyses see for example Moise et al., 1988). Establishing a SESOI will also improve the planning of new studies such as when conducting power analyses. That is, via power analyses researchers will be able to accurately estimate the number of participants necessary. This can inform researchers whether they have adequate funding to conduct a meaningful study or save funding by not collecting more data than necessary. Interestingly, similar to other fields (e.g., motor behavior research; McKay et al., 2022;Mesquida et al., 2023), the majority of eyewitness identification studies did not conduct power analyses. Moreover, when power analyses were conducted, they were oftentimes not reproducible. These findings highlight the need for researchers to conduct power analyses and make them reproducible just as their data and analyses (Lakens, 2022;Hardwicke et al., 2022). Although power analyses for ROC curve analyses and AUC values can be conducted via the R package ""pROC"" (Robin et al., 2011), further work is necessary to allow more contextualized power analyses using for example the SESOI (but see Mah, 2022).","The following text is part of a scientific article.

Specifically, installing the required sensor at the contact location can cause inaccurate results or change the original behavior of the test subject.","The following text is part of a scientific article.

When inferring a population effect through an empirical sample, the computed effect is only an estimation, which attempts to approximate the true population effect but is influenced by various uncertainties inherent in the sample. This is why participant sample size is one of the main considerations in designing experiments. Despite its importance, there is still no well-established routine to adequately justify sample sizes (Lakens, 2022), leading to samples that may not be sufficiently powered to detect the desired effects -in this case, an interaction between awareness and learning. A common argument to justify testing a specific number of participants is that the sample size is similar to previous ones in the same literature, but this does not guarantee that those sample sizes were sufficiently informative. For instance, in the domain of location probability learning, which is the main focus of the present study, median sample sizes are typically between 16 and 24 . With these samples, the minimum detectable correlation 1 with 90% power is .705 for contextual and probabilistic cuing tasks and .601 for the additional singleton task . Given that some amount of measurement noise is a very reasonable assumption in 2 the measures taken in these tasks, there are good reasons to expect that the empirical correlations involving them will often be substantially smaller than these values.","The following text is part of a scientific article.

In addition, specific studies that observed leadership differences between public and private organisations never established the significance of the difference. For this study, a sample of public and private sector employees has implications for the broader application of the findings (Asim et al., 2021). The sample size for this study follows the heuristic principle, as it adopted the general rule provided in the literature (Lakens, 2022). For example, the sample size met the recommendation of a minimum of five participants for each item measured in a study or a minimum of 20 participants for every focal variable of a study (Rahman, 2023;Zaman et al., 2021). Hence, this study sample size was deemed sufficient, considering the investigation of three focal variables totalling 27 items. Additionally, the chosen sample size adhered to the principle that when the anticipated effect size is uncertain, a sample size suitable for a medium effect size is satisfactory; as such, a sample size of 163 provides more than 80% power to detect a relationship at a significance level of 0.05 if it exists (Althubaiti, 2023).","The following text is part of a scientific article.

(2020) to test hypothesis 1 (accessible at Veldkamp et al., 2020). Our sample size of N = 74 PRP-QUANT preregistrations already surpasses that of Bakker et al. (2020), which they determined through a power analysis for a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test with ɑ = .05 and a power of .8 to detect a medium effect size of Cohen's d = 0.5 (which corresponds to Cliff's D of approximately 0.33, Romano et al., 2006), a difference they defined as practically meaningful between two samples of preregistrations. Since our sample size is already determined by the number of available PRP-QUANT preregistrations, we conducted sensitivity analyses for our hypothesis tests (Lakens, 2022). Figure 1A shows a sensitivity curve depicting the relationship between effect size and power for testing hypothesis 1 given our current sample sizes, which was created in R (R Core Team, 2023) based on a power simulation with 1000 repetitions that incorporated the variability in the data from Bakker et al. (2020; see R script in the supplemental material, <https://doi.org/10.23668/psycharchives.14107>). This curve suggests that we would have a power of .97 to detect small effects of d = 0.2 for the overall difference in restrictiveness between templates, employing a nested Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test and ɑ = .05. Meanwhile, an effect size of d = 0.5 would be detectable with a power above .99. Since the effect size found in Bakker et al. (2020) was even higher (D = 0.49, which resembles d of about 0.8, Romano et al., 2006), an effect of similar size could therefore also be detected with a high power.

Participants acted as dictators in a modified DG, in which they received an initial endowment of tokens and unilaterally made decisions, either for themselves or for others, to allocate some portion to an anonymous recipient. In each round, the relative gains and losses of dictators and recipients were manipulated by applying separate self and other multiplier ratios to convert tokens into payoffs for the dictators and the recipients, respectively. Leveraging the quantitative nature of the experimental design, we employed computational models to disentangle specific cognitive processes through which the framing effect influences children's fairness behaviors/knowledge. Computational modeling aims to uncover cognitive processes driving observed behavioral patterns by employing mathematically precise equations (Hu et al., 2017;Gao et al., 2018;Husain and Roiser, 2018;Yu et al., 2018). Computational models reflect the instantiations of cognitive hypotheses, with the merit of allowing for precise predictions and quantitative test of competing hypotheses (Ahn et al., 2017;Wilson and Collins, 2019). In the current study, we investigated several hypotheses on the underlying cognitive processes of explicit fairness behaviors/knowledge as well as how loss-gain frame interacts with those processes to modulate fairness decision-making. For fairness behaviors, it was hypothesized that both children and adults were averse to disadvantageous inequity, while potentially divergent preferences for advantageous inequity: children might be indifferent to advantageous inequity and even exhibit advantage-seeking preferences; in contrast, adults would be averse to advantageous inequity (Hypothesis 1). Regarding knowledge of fairness, we expected no significant differences between children and adults (Hypothesis 2). Lastly, it was hypothesized that loss (vs. gain) frame would reduce inequity aversion and increase advantage-seeking motivation among children while increasing inequity aversion among adults (Hypothesis 3). . ) participated in the current study. The sample size of current study was limited by the resources that are available (Lakens, 2022) and was comparable to the previous study on the similar topic (Morasse et al., 2022). The power sensitivity analysis was conducted with MorePower software (Campbell and Thompson, 2012). Using a 2 × 2 × 2 repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), effect size as small as η p 2 = 0.114 (RM = 2 × 2, IM = 2, α = 0.05, 1 -β = 0.80) can be reliably detected given the current sample size (Bakeman, 2005). The child participants were recruited from a primary school in Chengdu, China, and the adult participants were recruited from South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China. The Ethics Committee of South China Normal University approved the experimental design and participant recruitment. All participants were screened to ensure that they did not have any current or past neurological or psychiatric disorders, and provided informed consent before experiment.","The following text is part of a scientific article.

To determine our SESOI, we calculated different simulation analyses with the structure of the proposed structural equation model (SEM). While including different effect sizes in our simulation and keeping the α level (α = .05), power (90%), and sample size (N = 547) constant, we ran 1,000 replications for our model.

To answer this question, we performed a sensitivity power analysis (Lakens, 2022) estimating which effect sizes the Bayesian t-tests used can be expected to have sufficient power to detect given our sample size. Traditionally, 'power' refers to the probability of obtaining a statistically significant result at a given significance level (often α = 0.05), given certain a nonzero true effect-size. Since we performed Bayesian t-tests rather than frequentist t-tests, 'power' instead refers to the probability of obtaining a Bayes factor larger than 3 (which is commonly regarded as ""substantial"" evidence for the alternative hypothesis). Fig. 6 shows estimates of this probability for a range of effect sizes from 0 to 2 for the two comparisons investigated using Bayesian t-tests. As can be seen, effect sizes of about 1 and larger can be expected to be detected with a probability close to unity based on this criterion, while the probability of detecting an effect size of 0.5 would be less than 0.5. Each point shown in Fig. 6 was obtained by drawing 3000 samples of random normally distributed data for the effect size in question, performing a Bayesian t-test for each random sample, and computing the proportion of cases where the Bayes factor was larger than 3. The number of participants for the each of the two groups in each comparison in the simulation was the same as in our study (see Tab. 1). The curve for the comparison between magicians (n = 53) and (male) controls is somewhat higher than the curve for the comparison between magicians and (male) actors, because there were more controls (n = 39) than actors (n = 28) in our sample. The Bayesian t-test in the simulation were performed using the Bayes Factor package (Morey et al., 2022), which is also used by JASP. The prior was the same as in the analyses we performed using JASP (Cauchy with scale parameter 0.707).","The following text is part of a scientific article.

Non-ideal spacing between ratings occurs in options 2 (Disagree) and 4 (Agree). The ideal rating criteria are met when the rating scale analysis > 1.4 logit. If the logit value of the rating < 1.4, it is recommended to merge the rating scale. If the ratings are not merged, it signifies that the 5-Likert scale on the cognitive load instrument lacks adequate discrimination and has overlapping thresholds in various items, so the response format is considered for modification (Boone & Staver, 2020;Casale et al., 2023). Figure 6, part (a), shows the graph before merging the ratings, and part (b) displays the graph after merging the ratings. After merging rating 2 with rating 1 and rating 4 with rating 5, the logit values of the ratings become ideal according to the rating scale analysis criteria. Based on the main findings outlined, the following recommendations are considered strategic steps to provide reinforcement and positive contributions to the development of the cognitive load scale within the context of the formal definition of limits. The unique characteristics of the mathematical context and learning environment introduce contextual variations in measurement outcomes, rendering research results non-generalizable (Fennell & Rowan, 2001;Wang et al., 2020). Referring to this, conducting external validation according to Ho et al. (2020) and Quintão et al. (2020) offers the possibility of generalizing results, validating contextual applicability, and identifying variability. Furthermore, expanding contextual variables is also a consideration in constructing the cognitive load scale. Rationalizing research findings can provide a more realistic depiction of material complexity, yield a more holistic analysis, and provide a comprehensive insight into factors contributing to cognitive load, determining which factors have the most significant impact (Breves & Stein, 2023;Mangaroska et al., 2022). Other recommendations focus on the coverage and diversity of respondents, which should at least be a researcher's consideration to ensure research results are more relevant, reduce potential bias, help improve accuracy in understanding population variability, and broaden the scope of respondents who need further empowerment (Johnson et al., 2020;Lakens, 2022).","The following text is part of a scientific article.

Our smallest effect size of interest was a correlation of .1 (Lakens, 2022). We chose this value for two reasons: First, as correlations between variables can be non-zero but negligible, the proposal that moral values and political orientation are associated becomes meaningful when the associations are not negligible. Correlations of 0.1 are typically labelled small, with correlations closer to zero being considered neg ligible. Second, in a recent meta-analysis of the associations between moral values and political orientation (Kivikangas et al., 2021), the smallest average association between a moral domain and political orientation was estimated at -0.15 with a 95% CI from -0.17 to -0.12. This suggests that associations between moral values and political orientation typically have an effect size of at least r = 0.1. Consequently, we formulated and tested the following seven hypotheses: something all children need to learn"" and is included in the Authority domain.

Effects can only be statistically significant if R 2 does not lie within the critical interval (Lakens, 2022). All the R 2 s from Table 2.6, 2.7, 2.8 &2.9 are larger than the matching calculated upper critical R 2 s from Figure D1-D4. Hence, we are able to detect statistically significant effects with our sample size. ρ 2 under H1 is the squared multiple correlation coefficient. The effect size f 2 is calculated from ρ 2 as follows: f 2 = ρ 2 /(1-ρ 2 ) (Cohen, 1988). Since the ρ 2 s under H1 are 0.22, 0.19, and 0.20 and 0.17 in Figure D1-D4, the minimum detectable effect sizes for the multiple regression models in Table 2.6-2.9 can be calculated as 0.28, 0.23, 0.25, and 0.20 respectively.","The following text is part of a scientific article.

The lack of formal power calculations in many published studies [6,8] reduces the credibility and generalizability of research findings. Incorporating power analysis into study planning is essential, especially as the field increasingly prioritizes reproducibility and transparent reporting. Researchers should clearly document the rationale for their sample sizes and the assumptions that support their calculations. Although G*Power was not used directly in this review, the sample size estimates were designed to reflect the outputs produced by G*Power using the standard settings. Alternative tools, such as R packages (e.g., pwr, simr) or software like PASS and SAS, can be used for more advanced or customized sample size calculations. Simulation-based methods also offer flexible solutions, particularly for complex models or non-standard assumptions, and can be implemented using platforms such as R and Python. Future work may extend these approaches using simulation-based or Bayesian power analysis methods, which offer flexible alternatives under complex study designs and prior-informed modeling frameworks [25,26]. By broadening the range of accessible tools and encouraging thoughtful planning, these strategies will ultimately improve the interpretability, reproducibility, and impact of nutritional research.","The following text is part of a scientific article.

The less control researchers have over the final sample size, the less flexibility there is in the data analysis, and therefore there is often little risk of biasing selection effects, as long as data-dependent stopping rules are avoided. Researchers typically perform the preregistered analysis on the data, even if the sample size turns out to be larger or smaller than planned. If researchers can convincingly argue that they did not engage in optional stopping or selective reporting (Simmons et al., 2011) a deviation in the preregistered sample size does not inflate the Type 1 error rate. A smaller number of observations than planned can reduce the severity of the test, but primarily because the lower statistical power for the effect of interest makes it less likely that the test will support the hypothesis if the hypothesis is true. A larger sample size than preregistered, all else equal, increases the test's severity, as the test is more likely to support the prediction when it is true. When sample sizes are substantially smaller, inconclusive results might have become more likely, and researchers might need to re-evaluate which research question they can adequately answer (Lakens, 2022).

Primero, mostramos que a pesar del respaldo nominal de los psicólogos empíricos a una baja tasa de hallazgos falsos positivos (≤ .05. Existen al menos seis maneras de poder justificar el tamaño de la muestra (Lakens, 2022); sin embargo, la de mayor uso es la de representatividad. Desde esta perspectiva, se considera que la forma clásica para muestreos aleatorios simples, que cabe aclarar que existen diferentes aproximaciones en dependencia del tipo de muestreo, es mediante la siguiente ecuación: La anterior forma tiene un uso central en la epidemiología (Milton, 2001;Polit, 2002) debido a que busca una sensibilidad suficiente para poder efectuar una prueba Z diseñada para muestras mayores de 130 sujetos. No obstante, esta aproximación es poco sensible en estudios observacionales o diseños experimentales en los que la población a estudiar suele ser pequeña o se tiene acceso a pocos sujetos en los que se objetiva el fenómeno. Por ejemplo, con esta aproximación, mientras menor sea la población, mayor es el número de la muestra; inversamente, si se tiene mayor población, menor será la muestra para representarla, es decir, si se tienen 100 sujetos de población, la muestra debe ser de 80, pero si se tiene una población de 1,000, la muestra tendrá que ser de 278, o si son 10,000, será de 370. Conforme la población vaya aumentando, la muestra se estabilizará, de tal modo que si ahora se tiene una población de 100,000, se necesitarán tan solo 383 en la muestra, o si son 1'000,000, será de 385 fijo por más que se incremente la población. Por ende, es poco realista que algún investigador que estudie fenómenos poco típicos, enfermedades raras o que cuente con recursos limitados pueda utilizar esta fórmula para justificar su n. Por ello, sugerimos utilizar el AP, que no es una propuesta novedosa, pero ha sido poco utilizada. Existen tres formas comunes de usarlo: el primero es denominado a priori; el segundo, calculando la sensibilidad; y el tercero es hacer un post-hoc. Con base en el objetivo de nuestro trabajo, solo profundizaremos en el primero, ya que es el que permite calcular la n en función de un δ de interés en particular para un fenómeno específico.

The mlpwr package provides a means to perform simulation-based power analysis for a broad class of applications (Zimmer and Debelak, in press). It fills two previously existing gaps in the literature by allowing for user-defined scenarios with multiple design parameters and explicitly accounting for the cost of study designs during the search algorithm. As Lakens (2022) recently pointed out, there are many power analysis tools available, but learning to use them effectively takes time.

Starting from the observation that most published research results might be wrong (Ioannidis, 2005;Simmons et al., 2011), there have been several developments to improve the replicability of scientific studies (Shrout and Rodgers, 2018). One of these are registered reports, in which research projects are reviewed and conditionally accepted based on sound methodology rather than on the statistical significance of the result. In registered reports, justification of sample size based on power analysis is usually mandatory. For example, in the journal Nature Human Behaviour, the sample size should be large enough to achieve at least 95% statistical power (Nature Human Behaviour, 2022). Looking at recent developments, registered reports are indeed accompanied by more frequent justification of sample size (Soderberg et al., 2021). Another means to ensure replicability is through pre-registrations, where key properties of the planned research are fixed before data collection and statistical analyses. A study by Bakker et al. (2020) found that pre-registered studies had larger sample sizes than earlier psychological studies. However, the study did not find that explicit recommendations for performing power analysis led to larger sample sizes. Although the sample size is still often only stated but not justified (Lakens, 2022), stating and justifying a sample size before conducting a study is arguably becoming common practice.","The following text is part of a scientific article.

First, the 13.9% benchmark can assist in model evaluation, that is, it will help researchers to answer the elusive question ""how good is my model?"". The benchmark also has implications for how much we emphasize personality traits in theoretical models and ascribe relevance to them in applied settings: It tells us that in a multivariate perspective, personality is substantially more predictive of behavior than is implied by single correlations (cf. Thielmann et al., 2020). In fact, the best single-trait model explained 9.3% of the variance in SVO-almost five percentage points less than the best multivariate model. Second, our findings regarding the adequacy of simple models (i.e., linear models, Pearson's correlation) support the mainstream statistical practice to consider linear effects of personality traits rather than nonlinearities and trait-trait interactions. Third, the finding that narrower traits out-predict basic personality should motivate researchers to map out more nuanced aspects of personality to complement basic personality dimensions in the prediction of prosocial behavior. In fact, our results suggest that the way toward better predictive models lies in improving our predictors (e.g., considering personality nuances; Seeboth & Mõttus, 2018) more so than in increasing the complexity of our statistical modeling practices. Importantly, however, in taking such a way forward, researchers should prevent introducing ever more construct inflation (Thielmann, Hilbig, & Zettler, 2022). Fourth, in the service of identifying relevant predictors, our contribution can inform power analysis decisions (Lakens, 2022): Because important traits tend to attain correlations of at least r = .20, sample size calculations should be set to detect effects of at least r = .20.

The moderated models showed convergent results for IDS preference, with infants showing a general preference to attend to IDS over ADS stimuli during early development across a wide variety of ages, task contexts and linguistic backgrounds. This analysis thus conformed to previous studies showing that the unique properties of IDS robustly captivate infants' attention from an early point in development (Cooper & Aslin, 1990;Pegg et al., 1992;Werker & McLeod, 1989;Fernald & Kuhl, 1987). The size of the IDS preference was also remarkably similar between the MA and the MLR: both data sources converged on an average effect size estimate of d ≈ 0.35. The convergence of the estimate across the two sources of evidence in such a broad range of conditions can aid developmental scientists in sample size calculations for future studies of IDS preference (Lakens, 2022). For example, the effect size estimate of d = 0.35 implies that a sample at least as large as N = 66 infants is needed to have 80% or greater power to detect an IDS preference at an alpha level of .05 in a within-participant design using a paired-samples t-test. Our full dataset is also openly available, allowing researchers to account for potential sources of variability and tune their power estimates to specific methodological and modeling choices. Why does IDS exert such an early, widespread effect on infants' preferential attention? One promising explanation posits that the engaging features of IDS reside in the mutual feedback loops between infant and caregiver, where infants' active participation and caregiver responsiveness both contribute to the developmental process (Warlaumont et al., 2014;Ko et al., 2016). Given that adults use IDS as a consistent signal in addressing children during development, infants may start to associate the acoustic features of IDS with relevance and to recognize themselves as recipients of these salient utterances (Nencheva et al., 2021). This elevated attention to the speech stream, in turn, may drive the commonly observed language benefits of IDS during development (Golinkoff et al., 2015;Hartman et al., 2017;Peter et al., 2016).","The following text is part of a scientific article.

On the whole, studies using survey-based platforms (such as Qualtrics) also had a considerably higher number of participants and a longer estimated time than studies using experiment-focused platforms (such as Gorilla). It is noteworthy that the median sample size for survey-based platforms was close to the minimum sample size typically recommended for survey-based research (Barlett et al., 2001), suggesting that the ability to more participants online has not necessarily translated to adequate and justifiable sample sizes for surveybased research (see Lakens, 2022 for more information on justifying sample sizes). We caveat this interpretation however, by highlighting that ∼5.5% of studies on Prolific and ∼24% of participants on Gorilla were studies with a sample size over 500, which clearly shows that despite the median being on the low side, researchers can and are recruiting large online samples. As low power due to inadequately small sample sizes contributes to research waste (Button et al., 2013), the potential for researchers to collect high quality data from large sample sizes quickly with online research platforms is particularly encouraging.","The following text is part of a scientific article.

First, this study employed a very small number of participants who were female only. Therefore, the presented results should be considered preliminary only and subject to confirmation in future research. We want to note that we have recently completed a follow-up study with a larger cohort of male participants. Second, we chose the sample size based on resource constraints regarding the limited number of available female participants for our laboratory experiments during the COVID-19 pandemic [89]. Third, although we minimized the potential learning effects in each participant by administering the different comfort levels in a random sequence unknown to the participants, the effects of potential learning effects have yet to be investigated. It should also be noted here that people may perform the same physical tasks repeatedly at work and in everyday life. Brain plasticity can affect neural signatures of body responses to such tasks [90,91]. Lastly, our laboratory study could have produced somewhat different results if a control condition with no force applied first was used. However, a substitute for the control provision was the application of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), which can be considered equivalent to a control condition. This is because, at first, each subject was asked to exert the maximum force to the best of her ability without stipulating any physical comfort level or other influence. Future studies should ruminate on the above considerations when investigating the neural signatures of physical exertions and the associated comfort of such exertions.","The following text is part of a scientific article.

This is because the research under consideration is about developing hypotheses and then testing them for determining the presence of association between the independent and dependent variables. Therefore, the use of explanatory approach is used in the current study for providing explanation regarding the association between different aspects related to production and elimination of waste in the construction industry. According to Knight et al. (2022), explanatory design is used in quantitative researches for formulating hypotheses and designing methodology for the purpose of data collection with the objective of testing the overall theory (Khan, et al., 2022a, b). The other aspect related to the adoption of research approach is the choice of deductive approach. The justification of using the deductive approach is the involvement of hypotheses and then testing them for analyzing the relationship between independent and dependent variables. Quantitative research design is being used in the current study for determining the degree or the extent to which different factors identified (Lakens, 2022;Rashid & Rasheed, 2022). Out of different types of research designs that can be applied, the one that is applicable in the current research is the causal design (Hashmi et al., 2020a, b). This is because it is a kind of research that is based on analyzing cause and effect relationship between the variables which is a key aspect of any particular quantitative study (Sürücü & Maslakçi, 2020).","The following text is part of a scientific article.

First, these data were collected after the start of and during the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, at which time the Tokyo 2020 Games were delayed, resulting in many athletes having to adjust to alternative training and competition schedules. The Beijing 2022 Games also introduced additional stressors for athletes that may not be present during a non-Games year, both related and unrelated to pandemic adjustments. These concerns likely influenced, to some degree, the prevalence of positive SMHAT-1 screens observed here. Moreover, these data, much like the original APSQ-validation studies, consist of athletes from a single country. It is acknowledged that this dataset is more diverse regarding sex, sport and seasons. However, additional data from other countries, especially countries with varying mental health educational systems, mental healthcare infrastructure and global sociocultural differences, should be analysed to confirm our results. Relatedly, only a small number of athletes were positively screened on subsequent questionnaires, especially on the PHQ-9 Q9. This small number of positive cases may produce biased estimates and unreliable (high or low) FNRs (see PHQ-9 Q9 in Winter athletes, table 2). We also acknowledge that more specific analyses of Paralympic athletes are required, accounting for category and degree of impairments. Regrettably, we do not have the requisite sample size to conduct this analysis, but we strongly encourage this in future SMHAT-1 studies. Although we included all available athletes in these analyses, we also acknowledge that the sample size may be underpowered, particularly for some of our subgroup analyses. To investigate this further, we calculated post hoc power analyses and reported those values in online supplemental material 1. However, we also recognise and acknowledge that post hoc power analyses have substantial statistical issues [22][23][24] and thus cannot necessarily be relied on to confirm adequate sample size for all analyses and comparisons. For example, the statistically significant differences in ASSQ score by season had a post hoc power (1-β) of <0.80, and thus these differences should therefore be interpreted with caution, although the true effect size in the population may not be represented by our observed effect size, and thus these power analyses may be misleading. We therefore further encourage other National Olympic and Paralympic Committees to continue collaborating and aggregating data to better understand how the SMHAT-1 can be improved for the sake of athletes' mental health and well-being.","The following text is part of a scientific article.

First, researchers must specify an expected effect size, which may be difficult. If neither a precise prediction nor previously reported effect sizes are available to guide the specification, a reasonable approach is to use the smallest effect size of interest (Lakens, 2022). This strategy, however, is related to a second challenge: The required sample size for a statistical test is a function of the test procedure (e.g., parametric vs. non-parametric tests), the desired 𝛼 (which is usually set to .05 or lower), the statistical power 1 -𝛽 (which is usually set to .80 or higher), and the hypotheses, that is, the expected effect size. When the effect size is small, the sample size required to ensure sufficiently low error probabilities is large. Unfortunately, psychological effects are typically small or medium sized (Funder & Ozer, 2019;Richard et al., 2003;Roberts et al., 2007). Thus, power analyses based on realistic effect-size expectations or smallest effect sizes of interest typically yield required sample sizes that exceed available resources. As a result, psychological studies are often based on too small sample sizes and thus underpowered (Button et al., 2013;Rossi, 1990;Szucs & Ioannidis, 2017).","The following text is part of a scientific article.

The large sample size presented in the experiment, about four to ve times larger than Simpson (1990) had the power to detect small, medium or large effects, given the sample size and after consulting power curvers (Lakens, 2022) such that if an even small gender effect was there, the current research would have detected it. Of course, there is still room to consider that there might have been a very small gender effect that escaped detection. Although highly avoidant men were the least distressed group out of the 4 gender/attachment style groups, the difference was not at a signi cant level in comparison to highly avoidant women (2% difference). A possible reason for a departure from Simpson's 1990 result could've been a difference in experimental design of the emotional distress measure. In the 1990 measure, the open-endedness of the questions, although measured on a likert scale, did not account for a participant's detailed account of emotional distress. This could have made it di cult to elicit detailed responses from any participant that is going through a breakup and may rather not be talking about their feelings-especially highly avoidant people who already have the tendency to avoid or suppress their emotions, with added societal pressure due to their gender. Furthermore, the experimental setting of a phone call which was used by Simpson 1990 is more personal than an anonymous online survey. Research has shown that people are more comfortable sharing personal details in an anonymous context (Joinson, 1999) and as a result Simpson's experimental design could have lowered the social-comfortability of participants, lowering the candidness of responses. Another experimental factor that could have contributed to Simpson's found gender difference could have been due to the mean age of the participants (18-19 years old) since research has shown that adolescent females favor higher levels of emotional intelligence, expression, and management than males of the same age (Ciarrochi et al., 2001).","The following text is part of a scientific article.

First, we conducted the studies only in Norway and the United States, making generalization beyond these two countries difficult. Second, we did not have a truly neutral baseline condition in any of the studies, which does not allow us to draw strong conclusions about the absence of the experimental effect. Third, we did not measure the objects of the emotions, which would have allowed us to understand more about the concrete elicitors, nor did we measure other sources of intentions, which would have allowed us to examine the potential effects of the conditions on other predictors of intentions. Fourth, a longitudinal design with a pre-measure of intentions could have allowed us to examine changes in intentions more directly. Fifth, the use of a behavioral measure that assesses efforts toward climate change mitigation without being influenced by many external variables could have increased the intentionbehavior consistency. Sixth, ideally, different emotions should be measured with the same level of detail (number of items), which we did not do. Finally, Studies 1-3 consisted of small samples that were based on sample size justifications due to rules of thumb or effect size conventions that have since been called into question (Lakens, 2022). The experimental effects on intentions and behavior were rather small and our samples were not adequately powered to detect such effects. The meta-analytic approach can somewhat redeem this shortcoming, but future studies would need to focus on more valid sample size justifications such as selecting the smallest effect of interest. Furthermore, given how much people are exposed to media already, a single media exposure is unlikely to bring about lasting behavioral changes (Abraham et al., 2010;Landmann, 2020), particularly for behaviors with significance for a person's identity, group belonging, and ideology. Even short-term motivational changes are difficult to achieve. For example, a study comparing fear-and hopeinducing videos about climate change with neutral ones found no effect of condition on willingness to act (Ettinger et al., 2021).","The following text is part of a scientific article.

Furthermore, we could not involve a large number of participants in the laboratory due to the COVID-19 lockdown. Furthermore, owing to an abundance of caution, they registered a protocol with Open Science Framework describing this sample size determination method. They included its URL in the same-named section of the manuscript (i.e., Sample Size Design). As a result, the reviewers found no fault with the sample size. Therefore, their paper was accepted for publication in the next journal. Congratulations! As seen above, nothing essential about the sample size changed. SPARKing has adjusted only superficial credibility. The sample size was justified by other reasons, although it was obtained through the stopping rule based on the researcher's convenience (i.e., the results supported their idea). Here, the researchers used two justification patterns listed by Lakens (2022) resource constraints and heuristics. The previous studies cited were chosen with great precision, although, in fact, the sample size of weight perception studies varies widely.

Specifically, the mere absence of a statistically significant effect tells us little about whether a publicly meaningful effect exists. Indeed, the authors reported that they powered the study to find an effect size ""determined based on the magnitude of effects observed in past studies"" [36] and did not report those calculations. Beyond this lack of transparency, there are two problems with powering the RCIRCA study to find previously reported effects. First, as we saw above, effect sizes in the literature are often overstated and so it is likely the RCIRCSA study was underpowered to find the effect they thought they were seeking. But, more importantly, the sample size justification did not fit with the RCIRCSA's inferential goal. Powering a study to find an effect size estimated from previous research is a justification based on the ""expected effect size"" [38]. In other words, the researchers are powering a study to find an effect of the size that research and theory predicts. However, that justification is only weakly (or perhaps not at all) related to the goal of determining whether it is safe to join trials.","The following text is part of a scientific article.

Perhaps most fundamentally, law and psychology researchers must transparently report their effect sizes, their sample size justifications (which often hinge on an effect size), and any calculations underlying that work [38]. As we saw [29], such reporting does not always occur, yet is important in evaluating the legal and policy implications of psychological research. Similarly, researchers should candidly report both how effect sizes may or may not accumulate in the across time and people. By way of analogy, psychological researchers have prescribed [39] constraints on generality statements for research, which may be especially useful for lay readers to understand why a study may not apply to a context or population. The same level of candor and transparency should also be routine when presenting effect sizes in applied research. Finally, law and psychology researchers should consider engaging in increased metaresearch-research on its own methods and processes [40]. This work is underway, including the previously discussed survey of false memory researchers about the smallest effect size of interest in their work [15] and scrutiny of the hungry judges study finding several reasons its findings were likely overstated (e.g., [29]). However, much more is needed and can generally follow the discussion above. For instance, large preregistered replication projects of foundational studies can help provide more precise estimates of effect sizes and can be used as a basis to begin to estimate heterogeneity of effects across populations and contexts [12,41]. This work can help replace more impressionistic metaresearch in law and psychology which often relies on subjective judgments of researchers about what work has reached ""general acceptance"" (see e.g., [42]). It can also supplement this comment, which has relied on case studies rather than a systematic survey of the literature. And, to capitalize on these efforts [40], researchers should conduct regular audits (in psychology generally, see e.g., [43]) of reporting practices in law and psychology to see if reform efforts are working-that is, if researchers and practitioners actually begin to report effect sizes more transparently and more cautiously.","The following text is part of a scientific article.

Para la obtención de la muestra se utilizó la fórmula de cálculo de proporciones para población infinita (al tratarse de más de 10 mil hogares en toda la ciudad, se asume una normalidad con distribución homogénea) (17), en el cual se introdujo un nivel de confianza del 95%, una prevalencia esperada del 81% y un error aceptado del 5%; según lo reportado por Sánchez y Mejía (13) en 2019. Finalmente se determinó un mínimo de 237 viviendas a encuestar, para lograr representatividad de la muestra. Criterios de inclusión y exclusión: se consideraron aptos para el estudio a todos los hogares con acceso a internet que estuvieran dentro de la zona urbana seleccionada, la cual se caracterizaba por una gran cantidad de farmacias del sistema público y privado, así como su alta densidad poblacional. La encuesta se hizo llegar a las personas que se identificaran como los administradores del hogar y/o cuidadores principales. Se excluyeron las zonas periurbanas colindantes, la población que llevaba viviendo menos de 6 meses (de acuerdo con la definición operativa de población flotante, ofrecida por el Consejo Nacional de Población en México) (18) en la zona delimitada y hogares donde habite solo una persona. Instrumentos: los datos fueron recabados en un periodo de tres meses, durante el año 2022, a través de una encuesta virtual de la compañía Google®. Dicha encuesta se distribuyó a través de redes sociales y mensajería instantánea para que las personas pudieran contestar desde sus hogares. Para los guardan (si poseen), así como la declaración de si creen que pueden tener medicamentos caducados, el mecanismo de disposición y finalmente, la autoevaluación sobre si los participantes creen que almacenan sus medicamentos de forma correcta. Análisis de datos: los datos obtenidos fueron exportados al software estadístico SPSS ® V 20, mediante el cual se calcularon medidas de tendencia central y dispersión (en cada una de las variables de la encuesta). Además, el análisis de riesgo se realizó con la medida del Odds Ratio (OR) y la prueba de Chi cuadrado (χ²) para independencia; esto con el fin de analizar la asociación entre los factores familiares y el almacenamiento de medicamentos.

One of the more effective ways to ascertain sample size is to run an a-priori power analysis. This analysis often necessitates a determination of what effect size is expected to be important. Popularly, researchers base this on what effects have been found in past relevant research, which are unfortunately lacking for this study. Alternatively, researchers may consider using the smallest effect size of interest (Lakens, 2022). However, as this study focused on assessing the usefulness of a potential induction technique, I was hoping to see a medium-large effect (d = .50 ;Cohen, 1988). This anticipated effect size aligns with meta-analysis of mood induction procedures estimated a mean effect of rm = 0.481 across 250 experimental inductions (Westermann et al., 1996). An a-priori power analysis was conducted via G*Power 3.1.9.6 (Faul et al., 2007). This analysis revealed that in order to achieve 95% power and an effect size of .50, with a 5% margin of error, I required a minimum of 45 participants. However, since I wanted to be able to assess effectiveness of each video as well, I knew I would likely need more than that.","The following text is part of a scientific article.

While these results may not entirely represent the whole survey cohort, many pharmacists also noted low perceived knowledge around regulatory changes affecting Pharmacist Only CBD products. This may reflect the fact that no Pharmacist Only CBD products are currently registered or marketed, meaning that pharmacists may not consider competency in this area a priority. The low levels of knowledge observed in this study are consistent with numerous surveys of pharmacists around cannabis-based medicines [31-34, 50, 51]. Indeed, the piecemeal approach to legalising MC has been identified as creating gaps in knowledge [51]. In one review, 58.9-81.9% of pharmacists were predicted to have a low perceived knowledge around MC [34], while only 5% of pharmacists in another survey of Californian pharmacists reported having 'professional level' knowledge around MC [33].

It is important to distinguish that the minimum effect size of interest discussed above, will in most cases differ to the observed difference in an experiment (for a similar argument see Dienes, 2019). Thus, the probabilities provided by the Tables should only be used as reference, and only when similar assumptions to the ones employed here can be justified (Lakens, 2022). To illustrate this, consider the study by Taikapi et al. ( 2022), who designed a within-subject experiment with sample size n = 15 to test the effects of a specific brain stimulation protocol on cortical excitability before and after stimulation. The authors were interested in testing for a minimum effect size of d = 0.7, and employed a Bayesian paired t-test, which reflected this prior assumption, for cortical excitability before brain stimulation and cortical excitability 45 minutes after brain stimulation. The t-test yielded a BF10 = 34.87. In general, brain stimulation studies are expected to result in data with high variability (Phylactou et al., 2022). Therefore, assuming high variability, we turn to Table 7 for reference. According to Table 7 a minimum effect size of d = 0.7, a BF10 ≥ 3 with such small sample size (n < 20) is less than 30% probable. However, this probability is only true if the observed effect size in the experiment is approximately d ≈ 0.7. In such case, if the experiment is repeated 10000 times, and the true effect size is d ≈ 0.7, then only 30% of the times a threshold of BF10 ≥ 3 will be reached. However, in the experiment of Traikapi et al., (2022), the difference before and after stimulation were consistent and large (d = 1.1), which eventually resulted in a higher BF. This is also discussed in previous work, which illustrated that the resulting BF in a given experiment relies heavily on the observed data and that, usually, assumptions reflected in the prior distributions have little impact on the resulting BF (Schönbrodt et al., 2017;van Ravenzwaaij & Etz, 2021;Wagenmakers et al., 2010).","The following text is part of a scientific article.

Additionally, participants' RT that were below 100 ms and 2.5 SD faster or slower than the mean RT per condition or those associated with timedout responses were rejected (2.94% of the data in the 2D modality and 1.86% of the data in the 3D version).

For N170, a 2 (race: White, Asian) × 2 (task demand: recognition, categorization) × 2 (hemisphere) × 2 (site: P7/8, PO7/8) repeated-measure ANOVA was performed (see Fig. 2B). The main effect of task demand for N170 was significant F(1, 26) = 14.786, p = 0.001, η 2 p = 0.363, with recognition (-3.95 ± 0.64 µV) demonstrating a larger N170 amplitude than categorization (-2.65 ± 0.56 µV) task demand. The main effect of race and the interaction effect of race and task demand were not significant (ps > 0.215, ηs 2 p < 0.059). The interaction between the hemisphere and task demand was significant F(1, 26) = 8.856, p = 0.006, η 2 p = 0.254; further analysis found that the right hemisphere demonstrated larger N170 amplitudes than the left hemisphere for both categorization (-3.06 ± 0.66 vs. -2.23 ± 0.50; p = 0.024) and recognition tasks (-4.44 ± 0.75 vs. -3.24 ± 0.57; p = 0.001), but with differing magnitudes. The interaction between hemisphere and race was significant F(1, 26) = 8.225, p = 0.008, η 2 p = 0.240, with White faces (-4.02 ± 0.67 µV) evoking larger N170 amplitude than Asian faces (-3.79 ± 0.69 µV) in the right hemisphere (p = 0.022, η 2 p = 0.186), and the N170 amplitude of White faces (-2.71 ± 0.52 µV) and Asian faces (-2.76 ± 0.51 µV) was not significantly different at the left hemisphere (p = 0.713, η 2 p = 0.005). The interaction between site, task demand, and race was significant F(1, 26) = 8.016, p = 0.009, η 2 p = 0.236. Further separate analysis found that the interaction between site and race was significant for the recognition task F(1, 26) = 4.400, p = 0.046, η 2 p = 0.145, with a marginally significantly larger N170 amplitude for White (-4.81 ± 0.66 µV) than Asian (-4.55 ± 0.68 µV) faces at P7/8 (p = 0.090), whereas a non-significant difference of N170 amplitude was found for both White (-3.16 ± 0.64 µV) and Asian (-3.28 ± 0.63 µV) faces at PO7/8 (p = 0.458).

Regarding the right hemisphere (P/PO8), the interaction between task demand and race did not reach a significant level F(1, 26) = 0.153, p = 0.69, η 2 p = 0.006. The main effect of site was significant F(1, 26) = 39.848, p < 0.001, η 2 p = 0.605, with P7/8 (-4.01 ± 0.60 µV) demonstrating a larger N170 amplitude than PO7/8 (-2.58 ± 0.57 µV). The main effect of the hemisphere was significant F(1, 26) = 10.036, p = 0.004, η 2 p = 0.279, so larger N170 amplitudes were observed for the right (-3.86 ± 0.68 µV) versus (-2.74 ± 0.51 µV) the left hemisphere. The other main and interaction effects were not significant (ps > 0.071, ηs 2 p < 0.120). Analysis of P2 was conducted with a 2 (race: White, Asian) × 2 (task demand: recognition, categorization) × 3 (site: Fz, Cz, Pz) repeated-measured ANOVA (see Fig. 2C).

The main effect of race was significant, F(1, 26) = 4.377, p = 0.046, η 2 p = 0.144, with White faces (1.26 ± 0.25 µV) resulting in a larger P2 than Asian(1.13 ± 0.24 µV) faces. The main effect of site was also significant, F(2, 52) = 15.132, p < 0.001, η 2 p = 0.368, reflecting a larger amplitude of P2 at Fz than Pz (1.96 ± 0.36 vs. 1.72 ± 0.38 µV; p = 0.001), and Cz than Pz (1.72 ± 0.38 vs. -0.101 ± 0.26 µV; p < 0.001). No other main or interaction effects reached significance (ps > 0.057, ηs 2 p < 0.132). For P300, a 2 (race: White, Asian) × 2 (task demand: recognition, categorization) × 4 (site: Fz, Cz, Pz, Oz) repeated-measured ANOVA was performed (see Fig. 2C). The main effect of task demand was significant F(1, 26) = 16.538, p < 0.001, η 2 p = 0.389, revealing that the recognition task (0.81 ± 0.15 µV) demonstrated a larger P300 than the categorization task (0.39 ± 0.20 µV). The main effect of site was significant F(3, 78) = 4.071, p = 0.027, η 2 p = 0.135, reflecting a larger amplitude of P300 at Pz (1.41 ± 0.32 µV) than Fz (-0.32 ± 0.33 µV; p = 0.024) and Cz (0.84 ± 0.26 µV; p = 0.035). The interaction between the site and race was significant, F(3, 78) = 6.610, p = 0.003, η 2 p = 0.203. Post-hoc analysis found that for Asian faces, a smaller amplitude of P300 was found at Fz (-0.47 ± 0.34 µV) than Cz (0.69 ± 0.29 µV; p = 0.036) and Pz (1.34 ± 0.31 µV; p = 0.018); for White faces, a smaller amplitude of P300 was found at Fz (-0.18 ± 0.33 µV) than Cz (0.97 ± 0.25 µV; p = 0.020). The other main and interaction effects were not significant (ps > 0.100, ηs 2 p < 0.101). To confirm that the given number of participants in the study were allowed to detect of sufficient power, we conducted a sensitivity power analysis using G*Power software 58 . The sensitivity power analysis can assess the minimal effect size to achieve 80% power when the sample size and alpha level are fixed 59 . A repeated measurement of ANOVA Analysis with 27 participants in our study would be sensitive to the effects of f = 0.230 (η 2 p = 0.050) with 80% power (α = 0.05), revealing that an observed effect size larger than η 2 p = 0.050 would have 80% power to detect the effect.","The following text is part of a scientific article.

Pandemic restrictions were not conducive to in-depth learning and created barriers in recruiting and establishing relationships with the participants. The COVID-19 pandemic also forced many farmers into financial crisis and under undue stress. Four out of the seven farmers who participated had never used a digital agriculture app and had sporadic internet access. In the farm areas where the internet was sporadic, this made online training and general app usage difficult. Participants in north Surrey had better internet access and had more exposure to technology making their experience more streamlined. Under the COVID-19 pandemic conditions, the gaps in internet connectivity create inequitable results for using the app. Due to the resource constraints as noted above, the small sample size of this study (n = 7) was justified (Lakens, 2022). This small sample size was helpful as the study required the researchers to be on stand-by to address the specific concerns of each participant and troubleshoot for a period of 2 months. While the sample size can be considered relatively small. As noted by Davies and Dodd (2002) applying ""quantitative notions of rigor to qualitative research provides a poor instrument for evaluating qualitative research"". In a study on appropriate sample size for qualitative research, according to Boddy (2016), small sample size can be justified when it helps show direction for a future research field and it can be justified if it focuses on in depth-qualitative research. Moreover, other acceptable reasons for small sample size include the nature of the topic (Morse, 2000), and the amount of time spent with the participant (Marshall et al., 2013), which in the case of this study involved a novel use of an app and 2 months of trial. Finally, qualitative studies investigating theme saturation found that data saturation became evident at six individuals in studies that conduct qualitative in-depth interviews (Guest et al., 2006). As such, while the sample may seem small, the purpose and scope of this study justifies a sample of seven. Most importantly, another study on digital agriculture and the trial of a novel recording scheme also engaged with seven farms (Newton et al., 2020).","The following text is part of a scientific article.

Starting from the observation that most published research results might be wrong (Ioannidis, 2005;Simmons et al., 2011), there have been several developments to improve the replicability of scientific studies (Shrout & Rodgers, 2018). One of these are registered reports, in which research projects are reviewed and conditionally accepted based on sound methodology rather than on the statistical significance of the result. In registered reports, justification of sample size based on power analysis is usually mandatory. For example, in the journal Nature Human Behavior, the sample size should be large enough to achieve at least 95% statistical power (Nature Human Behaviour, 2022). Looking at recent developments, registered reports are indeed accompanied by more frequent justification of sample size (Soderberg et al., 2021). Another means to ensure replicability is through pre-registrations, where key properties of the planned research are fixed before data collection and statistical analyses. A study by Bakker et al. (2020) found that pre-registered stud-ies had larger sample sizes than earlier psychological studies. However, the study did not find that explicit recommendations for performing power analysis led to larger sample sizes. Although the sample size is still often only stated but not justified (Lakens, 2022), stating and justifying a sample size before conducting a study is arguably becoming common practice.","The following text is part of a scientific article.

Generation of artificial data is however less often practiced and may be unfamiliar to applied researchers. An important prerequisite for generating data and planning a study design in general is the determination of the expected size of the effect to be studied (Lakens, 2022). There are many definitions of effect size that depend heavily on the statistical model used (e.g., Brysbaert & Stevens, 2018;Chalmers, 2022;Lorah, 2018). Options to determine an effect size include using the results of a meta-analysis, consulting with experts, or conducting a pilot study. To assist with data generation, many R packages offer special functions that can greatly help with this step. Examples are the simulate function in the lme4 package (Bates et al., 2015) and the simdata function in the mirt package (Chalmers, 2012). These functions can be used as a part of simulation functions to generate a data set with the desired study design parameters, such as a desired sample size. Because of this possibility, the mlpwr package is highly compatible with any existing artificial data generation functions in other packages and can be used in combination with them.","The following text is part of a scientific article.

None of these studies has attempted power calculations to estimate sample size. Moreover, in the current study, we intended to use multivariate techniques such as linear mixed effects modelling and multivariate multiple regression. To our knowledge, there is no precedent set to estimate statistical power using such techniques for multivariate outcomes such as body composition. While it is true that simulation techniques are available [see, e.g., (Kumle et al., 2021)], reliable simulations need reasonable estimates of the various sources of variance and covariance which we do not have. Therefore, our approach here is not to rely solely on inferential statistical methods that estimate probability, and which require adequate power. Instead, we will focus primarily on model building through testing changes in the Akaike information criterion (AIC; Akaike, 1973) to compare the adequacy of multiple models as a fit to our data (Burnham and Anderson, 2002;Wagenmakers and Farrell, 2004).

To the best of our knowledge, currently no studies have been performed in which spinal movement control, as defined in the current paper, is both trained and assessed before and after training, which complicates the estimation of an expected effect size. For the study outcome to be clinically meaningful we have set the goal to detect or reject an arbitrary effect size of 0.25 (24). In other words, if the effect size would be below 0.25, we would consider this result to be too small to be of interest. Differences in movement control of the spine in low back pain patients and healthy controls in terms of tracking error of a spinal movement controlled tracking task were reported by Willigenburg et al. (12). The tracking error in healthy controls was 0.332 degrees (SD 0.103) and in low back pain patients 0.422 degrees (SD 0.634), which is a large effect size (>0.8). No data about the expected effect of a sensor-based movement control intervention on these outcomes are available. However, a recent study from Matheve et al. demonstrated that low back pain patients can alter their movement behavior using a sensor-based intervention during a single session (14). Hence, we expect that low back pain patients will be able to perform equally well on movement control tasks by the end of the intervention as healthy controls without an intervention. If the static motor control group reaches 75% of the effect of the sensor-based movement control group, corresponding to an effect size of 0.25 (considering the effect of the intervention is equally large as the standard deviation of the effect), a total sample size of 54 (27 per group) would suffice to demonstrate a Group x Time interaction effect at a power of 95%.

Participants represented a range of team sports, including soccer, rugby and basketball. An a priori sample size calculation using G*Power 3. 1.9.6 (Faul et al. 2007) informed our sample recruitment. A sample size of nine was estimated to detect a one-tailed effect of d = 0.93 with a power of 80% and error rate of 5% using a paired-samples t test. The effect size of interest (d = 0.93) was estimated based on differences in maximal oxygen uptake for running and cycling in trained students (McArdle and Magel 1970), with the one-tailed option selected because of the systematically higher VO 2 values observed in running compared to cycling (Millet et al, 2009).

Volitional exhaustion was defined as either the point at which participants could no longer maintain a cycling cadence of 50 rev min -1, or the speed of the treadmill. Expired air was collected continuously throughout each exhaustive trial using a pre-calibrated metabolic cart (Quark RMR, Cosmed, Cosmed.SRL, Italy).

Often, it is difficult to determine the effect size for a priori power analyses and so researchers can consider initially conducting a hypothesis-generating or exploratory study followed by a high-powered replication study that confirms the results (see more information about sample size justification and a priori power analyses in Lakens, 2022). The research conducted by Tabri and Palmer (2020) using the emotional Stroop task in the context of eating disorders provides an example of this approach with pre-registration.","The following text is part of a scientific article.

After data collection was completed for Experiment 1, the two groups of researchers became aware of each others' mutual interest in replicating Smith et al.'s (2019) experiments. Both groups of researchers thus decided to conduct an international multiuniversity and pre-registered replication of Smith et al.'s experiments to better understand the true nature of the effect of posture on cognition. As a result, the reader will notice slight differences across the study protocols (e.g., whether demographic information was collected or not). Across all three replication experiments, we chose sample sizes that would ensure high statistical power to detect not only effect sizes of the magnitude originally reported by Smith et al. (2019), but also to detect minimum effect sizes of interest (Lakens, 2022). Table 1 summarizes the originally reported effect sizes of the Smith et al. experimental paradigms, as well as the minimum effect sizes of interest (in addition to their corresponding statistical power) for the current replication work. Statistical power was calculated for repeated trials (Goulet & Cousineau, 2019) using SuperPower (Lakens & Caldwell, 2021; Supplemental Materials on <https://osf.io/kwrjd>). The minimum effect sizes of interest in the replication experiments fall within the upper end of the small range.

In addition, participants did not work during night shifts and were not diagnosed with sleep disorders and they did not travel across time zones. Finally, they did not report any stressful events such as exams or deadlines before or during the experiment. The experiment was approved by the UCL ethics committee (ID number: 8951/002) and all research was performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant before starting the experiment. Participants were compensated financially for their participation.","The following text is part of a scientific article. It contains a citation to a paper on sample size justification.

We also hypothesized that expressing gratitude may give rise to specific negative socially oriented emotions such as feelings of indebtedness, guilt, embarrassment, shame, and discomfort. Employees from four French companies and one French-Canadian company completed Study 1 online (N = 224, 71.4% female, M age = 37.17, SD = 9.08). Most participants had completed college (46.4%), with 21.0% of participants having completed graduate school, 20.5% having completed some college, 7.1% having completed high school, and 4.9% of participants having not completed high school. Information about ethnicity was not collected due to regulations from the Commission Nationale Informatiques et Libertés (CNIL). We aimed to recruit 100 participants per condition [62]. However, our sample was composed of busy working adults who are notoriously difficult to enlist, and we could not reach this target. Thus, we recruited as many participants as possible until the available subject pool was exhausted [63]. No participants were excluded, and we did not conduct analyses until the final sample size was collected. We performed a sensitivity power analysis using GPower [64]. Because we had a directional a priori hypothesis, we used a one-tailed test. The power analysis indicated that the smallest effect size that this sample could detect with 80% power was Cohen's d = 0.38 (equivalent to Cohen's f = 0.19). The study was translated into French by a professional translation service (Gengo), and then reviewed by several native French speakers who made minor adjustments.","The following text is part of a scientific article.

In reality, however, sampling plans may often be determined by external factors such as resource constraints (e.g., time, funding or sample characteristics), which reflect another, albeit limited justification for sample size 58 . Often resource constraints and heuristics result in too small sample sizes, leading to lower statistical power and thus over or underestimation of true effects due to imprecision in the outcome estimate. This is why in particular small studies are more likely to yield outcome estimates that are not as reliable and should thus not be a basis for future sample size calculations 60 .","The following text is part of a scientific article.

Researchers should justify their choice of SESOI and may use anchors specific to their research question. For instance, when powering for group or condition differences, other measures (e.g., clinical or behavioral) can be used as an anchor for a SESOI. To provide an example from clinical research, it has for instance been estimated that improvements in depressive symptoms may need to exceed a standardized mean difference (SMD) of at least 0.24 to be considered a clinically meaningful change 68 . If the goal of fNIRS recordings in the context of a depression trial is to detect accompanying hemodynamic correlates as a potential biomarker that can indicate clinically relevant improvements of depressive symptoms, the SESOI for hypothesized hemodynamic changes assessed by fNIRS should be at least SMD = 0.24 to be sufficiently sensitive and thus informative. An alternative anchor for SESOIs of hemodynamic effects may be effect sizes that are observed for behavioral effects. For instance, rates of anticipated non-responders (e.g., percentages of successful trials) can inform the lower effect size boundary. By using sampling plans that are based on SESOIs it is more likely to detect meaningful effects. Moreover, in the case of non-significant/inconclusive results, they are more likely to yield evidence for the absence of an effect through follow-up equivalence tests (or their Bayesian equivalent) that allow rejecting the alternative hypothesis 46,69,70 . In the context of hemodynamic brain imaging, such equivalence tests have been recently discussed for fMRI applications 71 .","The following text is part of a scientific article.

Admittedly, however, the study is not without limitations. For example, while the longitudinal sample size is comparable with other similar studies (e.g., Skarin et al., 2021;Shavit et al., 2021), the relatively few data points in the second wave of data collection limit the ability to identify small and moderate effect sizes with sufficient statistical power. Unfortunately, the small sample size in the second wave of data collection was impossible to fully circumvent, as participants were free to choose whether to complete the follow-up survey. Still, considering that the surveys were distributed several months apart and that the response rate during the first wave of data collection was not substantially larger than that of the second wave of data collection, the results should reasonably have some predictive validity. Indeed, of the 153 households who could download the app and reply to the initial survey, 59 households (38.56%) decided to do so, corresponding to 66 residents as some households had more than one adult who replied to the initial survey. Subsequently, 18 of those 66 residents (27.27%) also completed the follow-up survey, with these response rates being common in studies relying on similar designs (Kirkwood and Walton, 2014;Siegrist et al., 2015). Nevertheless, future research should include more households to overcome the limitation associated with small sample sizes and preferably conduct a priori power analyses to ascertain that the effect sizes of interest can be detected with sufficient statistical power given the set target sample size (Lakens, 2022). Moreover, as no mediating or moderating variables were documented in the current study, scholars addressing similar topics should optimally try to elucidate the specific psychological mechanisms driving the obtained effects, while simultaneously examining the replicability, generalizability, and boundary conditions of the current results. For example, several studies have shown that certain individual-differences factors may shape individuals' sustainability-related responses (Luchs and Mooradian, 2012;Folwarczny and Otterbring, 2021;Vizcaíno et al., 2021) as well as the extent to which they are influenced by social norms (Cialdini et al., 1999;Perugini and Gallucci, 2001;Stankov, 2011). Thus, future research should preferably include measures related to, for example, people's personality traits, cultural values, and the importance put on environmental protection to shed further light on whether, when, and why social norms may foster sustainable responses with a clear social connotation. As such, while this empirical investigation constitutes the first preliminary step for examining the theorizing proposed herein, more research is needed to gain a deeper understanding of the studied outcomes and build a nomological network of cumulative evidence.","The following text is part of a scientific article.

However, many of these tutorials focus on LMMs and the most common study designs (see Kumle et al., 2021 for a tutorial that also covers more advanced settings). This narrow focus provides limited guidance for researchers using more complex study designs, especially when little prior knowledge about plausible effect sizes is available (see the discussion in Kumle et al., 2021). Simulation-based power analysis with GLMMs requires making a range of assumptions about the model structure that should align with the characteristics of the data being analyzed. Existing tutorials often rely on heuristics for specifying variance components (e.g., the standard SIMULATION-BASED SAMPLE SIZE PLANNING FOR GLMMS 9 deviation of random intercepts) or assume that results from meta-analyses or data from pilot studies are available to determine plausible values for all model parameters. However, in practice, knowledge about those parameters from prior studies is often limited, which makes specifying assumptions a practical challenge (see the discussion in Maxwell et al. (2008) and Kumle et al. (2021)). We will discuss a number of strategies on how to specify model parameters for application-specific, tailored data simulations in a later section.","The following text is part of a scientific article.
