<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Cross-modal association refers to the systematic coupling of a sensory feature in one modality to a sensory feature in another modality. A large body of research has provided evidence that humans systematically associate higher-pitched sounds with angular contours, higher locations in space, and smaller or brighter objects, whereas lower-pitched sounds are preferentially associated with smooth contours, lower locations in space, and larger or darker objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brunel, Carvalho, &amp; Goldstone, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Evans &amp; Treisman, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Spence, 2011)</ref>.

Combined with the near universality of the bouba-kiki effect, the latter finding argues against the idea that SSAs originate in any special grapheme-shape association.</p><p>Since the discovery of SSAs, the question of whether they are innate or learned has attracted considerable speculation. The near universality of the bouba-kiki effect and the presence of a moderate bouba-kiki effect in toddlers and even prelexical infants have served as evidence that SSAs have an innate basis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Maurer, Pathman, &amp; Mondloch, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ozturk, Krehm, &amp; Vouloumanos, 2013)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Pejovic and Molnar (2017)</ref> found evidence that audiovisual SSAs are present by 12 months of age. However, the strongest counterargument for the innateness hypothesis comes from the seminal work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fryer, Freeman, and Pring (2014)</ref>, who tested an audiohaptic version of the bouba-kiki effect in blind and partially sighted individuals who matched the pseudowords with haptically perceived shapes. Their findings were contrary to what would be expected if SSAs were innate: Congenitally blind participants in their study did not exhibit any systematic SSAs. A mixed group of late-blind and partially sighted individuals was found performing at an above-chance level, but these participants had a significantly reduced SSA compared with sighted controls.</p><p>A recent study in a larger sample of early-blind participants (blindness onset &lt; 2 years of age) and lateblind participants (blindness onset ≥ 3 years of age in the sample) corroborates the claim that SSAs depend on visual experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hamilton-Fletcher et al., 2018)</ref>, although other researchers have suggested special conditions under which SSAs may occur in the early blind (defined as blindness onset &lt; 4 years of age; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bottini, Barilari, &amp; Collignon, 2019)</ref>. Moreover, no evidence for cross-modal associations between tactile and auditory motions (e.g., a link between increasing pitch and upward motion) has been found in early-and late-blind individuals (defined, respectively, as those with blindness onset ≤ 3 years and after the age of 5 years) but has been observed in sighted individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Deroy, Fasiello, Hayward, &amp; Auvray, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, existing research suggests a crucial role of visual experience in the emergence of some crossmodal correspondences. However, it is still unknown whether there is a sensitive period for cross-modal correspondences, such as the SSA, to be acquired or stabilized. Sensitive periods in development are epochs during which experience has an unusually strong impact on brain functions; after the end of the sensitive period, the acquisition of the same representations is impossible or incomplete <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Knudsen, 2004)</ref>. Determining sensitive phases in typical human functional development requires investigating individuals who suffered a period of blindness at birth but regained vision later. Such individuals allow researchers to determine whether a particular function, such as SSAs, can be acquired after the sensory input that seems to be crucial for its acquisition, such as vision for SSAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fryer et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hamilton-Fletcher et al., 2018)</ref>, becomes belatedly available. In the present study, we tested 30 participants who were born with total bilateral dense congenital cataracts (CC group) and subsequently underwent cataractremoval surgeries. If SSA acquisition depends on a sensitive period in early ontogeny, we would expect a similar pattern of results in an additional group of 15 congenitally permanently blind individuals (CB group)that is, we would not find the systematic association between sounds and haptic-shapes that we would expect to find in a group of 70 typically sighted control participants (TS group).</p><p>Another crucial aspect of sensitive periods is that representations acquired during such periods are not lost <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Knudsen, 1998)</ref>. Thus, individuals who lose their vision after the sensitive period are expected to show systematic sound-haptic-shape associations, as the typically sighted do. This hypothesis was tested in an additional group of 12 late-blind individuals (LB group)-that is, people with blindness onset after the age of 12 years, when multisensory development as assessed in prospective studies comes to or has come to an end <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hillock-Dunn &amp; Wallace, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Nardini, Jones, Bedford, &amp; Braddick, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Röder, Pagel, &amp; Heed, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, investigating CC individuals allows us to study the recovery of sound-visual-shape correspondence as well. It could be argued that newly gained sight should allow the acquisition of SSAs (or, more generally, the acquisition of cross-modal associations) from the statistics of the natural environment, even if sight becomes available only late. This finding would clearly argue against an early sensitive period for the acquisition of SSAs. Since CC individuals typically still have visual impairments following surgery and recovery, we tested an additional group of 24 individuals with late-onset cataracts after cataract extraction (DC group). DC individuals underwent the same surgical treatment as the other cataract patients and also had some remaining visual impairments. All DC participants tested in the present study had suffered from markedly degraded vision before the age of 12 years. Inclusion of this group allowed us to test whether SSA acquisition is interrupted solely by a phase of congenital total loss of pattern vision or whether later phases of severe visual impairments during childhood also interfere with functional SSAs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>One hundred fifty-four individuals participated in this experiment. Thirty had their vision restored after having total bilateral dense congenital cataracts (CC group; mean age = 18.9 years, range = 6-46 years; 12 female; 28 right-handed; geometric mean visual acuity = 0.207, range = 0.014-0.7, no acuity data for 1 participant; average age at surgery = 58 months, range = 1 month-33 years). Twenty-six had surgery to remove developmental cataracts (DC group). Two participants in this group were rejected because of a history of developmental delays. The 24 remaining DC participants had the following characteristics: mean age = 13.83 years, range = 9-29 years; 13 female; 19 right-handed, 4 with unknown handedness; geometric mean visual acuity = 0.390, range = 0.003-1.00; average age at surgery = 9.30 years, range = 2-17.5 years. All DC individuals had suffered a period of degraded vision before the age of 12 years. We transformed the decimal visual acuities to LogMAR values to meaningfully compare the CC and the DC groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Holladay, 1997)</ref>. The DC group had a significantly higher visual acuity than the CC group-one-sided t test, t(38.877) = 2.064, p = .023.</p><p>Fifteen participants who lost their vision because of congenital peripheral defects, such as severe forms of Leber's congenital amaurosis, bilateral congenital anophthalmos, or aggressive retinopathy of prematurity (Stage 5), also took part in the experiment (CB group). One CB participant could discern hand movement at 10 cm; the rest had at most light-projection capacity. Their mean age (also mean blindness duration) was 27.87 years (range: 18-55 years); 6 were female, and 12 were right-handed. Additionally, 13 participants with late permanent blindness were tested for the study (LB group); 1 was excluded for a history of brain tumors and surgery. The remaining 12 had a mean age of 35.33 years (range = 21-61 years) and a mean blindness duration of 9.79 years (range = 6 months-39 years); 5 were female, and 11 were right-handed. Furthermore, 70 TS control participants (mean age = 24.04 years, range = 6-56 years; 52 female; 57 right-handed, handedness data of 6 participants were unknown) took part in the experiment.</p><p>All CC, DC, CB, and LB participants were recruited at the LV Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad, India, or from the local community of the city of Hamburg, Germany (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for distributions of countries of origin and testing). The control participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, typical development of all sensory systems, and no neurological disorders. They were recruited from the local community in either Hyderabad, India, or Hamburg, Germany. All visually impaired individuals who participated in the study (CC, DC, CB, and LB participants) were free of any other sensory-system problems and did not have any neurological disorders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical approvals</head><p>The study was approved in parallel by the institutional ethical review board of LV Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad, India, as well as by the local ethical commission of the University of Hamburg Faculty of Psychology and Movement Sciences. The study conformed to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (2013). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consent and compensation</head><p>All participants provided written informed consent for the study. Additionally, the blind participants were orally informed about the general details of the study, data-security policies, and their right to terminate the experiment or withdraw consent for the preservation of collected data at any time. For participants who did not understand English or German, we also orally provided the same information in a language they could fully understand (e.g., Telugu, Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, or Tamil). For minors, a legal custodian's written informed consent was also obtained. For taking part in the study, adult participants received a small monetary compensation, and the expenses associated with participation (e.g., travel costs) were reimbursed. Minors received a small present instead of monetary compensation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental design</head><p>Stimuli. We decided to test SSAs rather than other cross-modal correspondences because results from previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fryer et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hamilton-Fletcher et al., 2018)</ref> have most consistently reported deficits for this type of cross-modal correspondence in congenitally blind or early-blind individuals. The set of stimuli consisted of five object pairs, four of which were haptic pairs and one a visual pair (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Each pair consisted of one object with a smooth shape or texture and another with a spiky shape or texture. Procedure. Separate questionnaires were used for TS participants, participants with a history of cataracts, and permanently blind participants to collect details pertinent to each group. The visual trial was run only in groups with visual capabilities (CC, DC, and TS). For all groups, a precomputed counterbalancing sheet was used to determine the order of trials, with the constraint that the visual trial in the CC, DC, and TS groups was presented either as the first or the last trial.</p><p>The experiment was conducted with a script (see Section S1 in the Supplemental Material available online), and instructions were provided in one of the languages the participant was able to understand well (English, German, Telugu, Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, or Tamil). The haptic pairs were handed to each participant one at a time in an opaque black cloth bag closed with a drawstring. Each participant received a haptic object pair exactly once, resulting in four trials involving all four haptic object pairs. Participants were instructed not to look inside the bag but instead to actively explore the contents of the bag by touching them. Thereafter, they were asked to bring out the object matching either bouba or kiki from the bag. The choice of whether to bring out bouba or kiki alternated each trial, and the sequence was counterbalanced across participants in combination with trial order (e.g., trial sequence: CBDAE; retrieval sequence: kikibouba-kiki-bouba-kiki; total cycle length: 4! × 2 × 2 = 96 for sighted participants, 4! × 2 = 48 for blind participants). At the end of all trials, participants were asked the reasons dictating their choices. Participants in the CC and the DC groups were also asked to partially copy the shapes of the objects in pair E visually to ensure that they were able to see the outlines in that pair.</p><p>Response coding. The object brought out or pointed to by the participant was coded on a response sheet. Subsequently, congruent matches were scored as 1 (i.e., kiki matched with an object with an orange background, and bouba matched with an object with a green background; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>); incongruent matches were scored as 0. In the visual modality, there was only a single trial. For the audiohaptic conditions, the average of the four trial scores was computed for each participant for visualization (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Therefore, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, a score of 1 indicates a completely congruent match in all four trials, and a score of 0 indicates a completely incongruent match. For the statistical analysis, we did not average the binary trials, instead modeling the possibly correlated nature of the trials with a random factor coded by participant ID.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>For the three groups with visual capabilities who took part in this task (CC, DC, and TS), we analyzed soundvisual-shape-association (SSA-V) trials using logistic regression models, which implement the maximumlikelihood method, in the R programming environment (Version 3.3.2; R Core <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Team, 2016)</ref>. Group (CC, DC, TS) was defined as a categorical factor. Employing two models, we first ascertained whether the probability of congruent SSA-V responses in the CC and the DC groups differed significantly from the probability of congruent SSA-V responses in the TS group (i.e., the difference from the TS group in log odds). Second, we examined whether a systematic SSA-V response was present in each of the groups-that is, whether the log odds of congruent SSA-V responses differed from chance level (zero log odds, P = .5) in each group (see Section S2 in the Supplemental Material for a detailed description).</p><p>All five groups (CC, DC, CB, LB, and TS) took part in the sound-haptic-shape-association (SSA-H) condition. Because each participant performed four trials, we employed a mixed-effects logistic regression model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bates, Mächler, Bolker, &amp; Walker, 2015)</ref> to test whether any of the visually impaired groups exhibited a statistically significant SSA-H reduction compared with the TS group. In this model, group (CC, DC, CB, LB, TS) was the fixed categorical factor and participant ID served as the random-intercept factor, taking into account the correlated nature of the data in each participant (see Section S2 in the Supplemental Material for a detailed description). Thereafter, we tested whether each group exhibited an SSA-H response that was significantly different from chance level by means of a zero-intercept version of the same mixed-effects logistic regression model. A priori sample-size calculations were performed using simulated data employing the (mixed) logistic regression models (see Section S2 in the Supplemental Material).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We tested the development and maintenance of crossmodal SSAs in an audiovisual condition (SSA-V) with participants who had recovered their sight (CC group, n = 30; DC group, n = 24) as well as in a control group of typically sighted participants without any history of visual impairments (TS group, n = 70). In the SSA-V condition, participants saw a stimulus pair and had to indicate which shape matched a pseudoword (either bouba or kiki). In the three aforementioned groups and in two additional groups of congenitally, permanently blind participants (CB group, n = 15) and late permanently blind participants (LB group, n = 12), we ran an SSA-H task using four different haptic-shape pairs. In each of the four trials, participants received a pair of haptic stimuli in an opaque bag and had to indicate which object of the pair matched the pseudoword (bouba or kiki). In the two cataract groups and in the typically sighted group, the audiovisual condition either preceded or followed the audiohaptic conditions in a counterbalanced fashion. In addition, the order of the audiohaptic trials was randomized. The responses were analyzed with generalized linear mixed models (see the Statistical Analysis section, as well as Section S2 in the Supplemental Material).</p><p>The audiohaptic responses were analyzed using a mixed-effects logistic regression model with group as the fixed factor. The correlated nature of four trials per participant was modeled by a random-intercept factor for each participant. Comparing the generalized linear mixed models using both a likelihood-ratio test and a parametric bootstrapping test revealed an overall difference in SSA-Hs between groups, χ 2 (4) = 25.846, p &lt; .001, parametric bootstrapping: p = .001. The consecutive logistic regression model revealed that the CC, the DC, and the CB groups, but not the LB group, significantly differed from the TS group (ΔCC: β = -3.856, 95% confidence interval, or CI = [-6.322, -1.813], SE = 1.122, p &lt; .001; ΔDC: β = -4.799, 95% CI = [-7.759, -2.463], SE = 1.306, p &lt; .001; ΔCB: β = -3.621, 95% CI = [-6.722, -0.963], SE = 1.420, p = .011; ΔLB: β = -1.799, 95% CI = <ref type="bibr">[-5.132, 1.165]</ref>, SE = 1.581, p = .255; see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). A second analysis to test for the presence of an SSA-H in each of the five groups revealed that only the TS and the LB groups exhibited a significant SSA-H at a higher-than-chance level (TS: β = 5.086, 95% CI = [3.584, 6.881], SE = 0.841, p &lt; .001; LB: β = 3.287, 95% CI = [0.289, 6.589], SE = 1.614, p = .042), whereas the CC, the DC, and the CB groups did not perform differently from chance level (CC: β = 1.230, 95% CI = [-0.479, 3.210], SE = 0.887, p = .165; DC: β = 0.287, 95% CI = <ref type="bibr">[-1.840, 2.510]</ref>, SE = 1.035, p = .782; CB: β = 1.465, 95% CI = <ref type="bibr">[-0.989, 4.265]</ref>, SE = 1.265, p = .247).</p><p>In the audiovisual condition, a similar likelihood-ratio test and parametric bootstrapping test revealed that there was an overall difference between the three groups, χ 2 (2) = 14.808, p &lt; .001, parametric bootstrapping: p &lt; .001. A logistic regression model revealed that both the CC and the DC groups displayed a significantly reduced SSA-V compared with the TS group (ΔCC: β = -1.706, 95% CI = [-2.751, -0.709], SE = 0.517, p &lt; .001; ΔDC: β = -1.577, 95% CI = [-2.674, -0.510], SE = 0.547, p = .004). Moreover, a second model-intended to ascertain the existence of any statistically significant SSA-V in the three groups-revealed that only the TS group, but not the CC group or the DC group, displayed a systematic SSA-V different from chance level (TS: β = 1.914, 95% CI = [1.267, 2.683], SE = 0.357, p &lt; .001; CC: β = 0.208, 95% CI = [-0.523, 0.957], SE = 0.373, p = .578; DC: β = 0.337, 95% CI = [-0.468, 1.178], SE = 0.414, p = .416; see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). A value of 1 on the y-axis indicates a congruent SSA-H or SSA-V (kiki was represented with an angular shape and bouba with a round shape). A value of 0 indicates a incongruent SSA-H or SSA-V (kiki was represented with a round shape and bouba with an angular shape). The dotted line indicates chance-level performance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In the present study, we investigated the presence of a sensitive period for the development of SSAs. Individuals who regained their sight through vision restoration surgery following a history of a transient congenital or developmental visual impairment due to cataracts were tested in both an audiohaptic (SSA-H) and audiovisual (SSA-V) context, as were sighted control participants. Additionally, congenitally and late permanently blind individuals took part in the SSA-H task.</p><p>As predicted by the assumption of a sensitive period in early childhood, we found no evidence for a systematic SSA-H in both the CC and the CB groups. The CB group's data replicated previous results in similar groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fryer et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hamilton-Fletcher et al., 2018)</ref>, suggesting an essential role of developmental vision for the emergence of SSAs. Crucially, LB individuals showed a significant SSA-H indistinguishable from that of the TS group. This pattern of results demonstrates two remarkable things about sensitive phases: Visual input during childhood development is necessary for the acquisition and stabilization of representations, which seem to be invulnerable to even drastic and long-lasting changes, such as late permanent blindness for up to 39 years. Furthermore, the CC group did not demonstrate an SSA-V either, suggesting that the belatedly available audiovisual-shape statistics were insufficient for SSA acquisition. The absence of SSAs in the audiovisual and audiohaptic domains further supports the notion of ontogenetically early visual input (&lt; 12 years) driving SSA acquisition. The latter is supported and qualified by the findings in the DC group: Like the CC group, the DC group lacked SSAs in both audiovisual and audiohaptic contexts. Since first indications of the bouba-kiki effect have been demonstrated in children and even in infants <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Maurer et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ozturk et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Pejovic &amp; Molnar, 2017)</ref>, an intact SSA-H effect in the LB group but not in the DC group suggests that a typical or high visual capability must exist over a protracted developmental phase to elaborate and stabilize cross-modal correspondences such as SSAs; once acquired, these representations seem to be resilient to changing visual environments.</p><p>The absence of SSAs in the DC group is remarkable because we have previously demonstrated much higher recovery of extrastriate processing in this group-partially indistinguishable from that of TS individualscompared with CC individuals <ref type="bibr">(Sourav, Bottari, Kekunnaya, &amp; Röder, 2018)</ref>. This observation encompasses face processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Röder, Ley, Shenoy, Kekunnaya, &amp; Bottari, 2013)</ref> and visual global motion processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bottari et al., 2018)</ref> in the DC group. Because all DC individuals suffered from degraded vision before the age of 12 years, the absence of SSAs in this group provides strong evidence for a protracted sensitive period for SSAs before the age of 12 years. Moreover, since all LB individuals in the present study had typical vision until this age, we can conclude that 12 years of intact vision is sufficient for SSA acquisition. Finally, the results of the CC and the DC groups strongly suggest that possible mechanisms of sound-symbolic associations, such as statistical co-occurrence <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Sidhu &amp; Pexman, 2018)</ref>, have sensitive-period constraints, because otherwise both CC and DC groups would have exhibited SSA-Vs driven by extensive exposure to audiovisual statistical properties after sight restoration. Moreover, this account does not explain why the CB group, as well as the CC and DC groups, did not develop normal SSA-Hs.</p><p>This pattern of results resembles previous findings in late-blind humans-for example, in the context of spatial reference frames for tactile processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Collignon, Charbonneau, Lassonde, &amp; Lepore, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Röder, Rösler, &amp; Spence, 2004)</ref> and auditory processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Röder, Kusmierek, Spence, &amp; Schicke, 2007)</ref>. Late-blind individuals seem to use visual spatial representations despite having suffered partially longer durations of blindness than the CB individuals, who relied in these tasks mostly on body-centered reference frames. Moreover, studies in owls fitted with prisms for a transient phase during the juvenile sensitive period demonstrated that deviant cross-modal spatial associations learned during this period were not lost after prism removal and could be reevoked in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Knudsen, 1998)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fryer et al. (2014)</ref> reported diminished SSA-Hs in a mixed group of late-blind and partially sighted <ref type="bibr">individuals, and Hamilton-Fletcher et al. (2018)</ref> found a lower SSA-H in late-blind participants (blindness onset ≥ 3 years) for low-pitched stimuli. On the basis of our results, we hypothesize that the reported SSA-H reductions might reflect averaging artifacts caused by including late-blind individuals with different histories of visual impairments. Reanalyzing the data of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hamilton-Fletcher et al. (2018)</ref> provided evidence for this hypothesis: Including only LB individuals with blindness onset after 12 years of age (N = 23), we found a robust SSA-H response that was indistinguishable from the SSA-H of the TS group of the same study (see Section S3 in the Supplemental Material). These findings in the LB group are reminiscent of the higher systematic sound-meaning associations that researchers have observed for words typically learned earlier in language acquisition, with the highest association for words acquired before the age of 13 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Monaghan, Shillcock, Christiansen, &amp; Kirby, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>It could be argued that the LB individuals had a generally shorter blindness duration compared with that of CB individuals and that a longer blindness duration might have abolished SSA-H effects in this group. Impressively, however, the LB individual with the longest blindness duration (39 years) showed a fully typical SSA-H in our study, as the LB participant in the <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hamilton-Fletcher et al. (2018)</ref> study did (40 years). Additionally, we found no systematic correlations between SSA-H and blindness duration in LB individuals in the present study or in the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hamilton-Fletcher et al. (2018;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> see Section S3 in the Supplemental Material). Thus, it seems highly unlikely that the blindness duration could account for the difference in SSA-H between the CB and LB individuals.</p><p>Although both vision and touch allow shape perception, visual dominance for shape acquisition could be predicted because of the higher spatial resolution afforded by vision, which in turn could foster SSA development and elaboration. If vision, however, does not provide more precise shape information during early ontogeny, SSAs might not be formed or elaborated for visual as well as for haptic shapes. In this context it is remarkable that an emergence of new cross-modal associations has been reported in earlyblind individuals (blindness onset &lt; 2 years of age): Unlike sighted participants, early-blind individuals consistently associated higher pitch with smoother or softer textures <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hamilton-Fletcher et al., 2018)</ref>. Texture can be well perceived by touch, and earlier work has shown that tactile and visual texture information are equally weighted in situations of visual-tactile conflict, unlike in shape conflicts, in which vision dominates <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">( Jones &amp; O'Neil, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rock &amp; Victor, 1964)</ref>. Cross-modal correspondence might thus be defined by the dominance pattern of available sensory inputs, which in turn might be defined by the appropriateness of a sensory modality to process certain object aspects (modality appropriateness; <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Welch &amp; Warren, 1980)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we compared the SSA-V and SSA-H effects of the non-Indian TS subgroup to the Indian TS subgroup and found them to be indistinguishable (see Section S4 in the Supplemental Material), corroborating previous findings that SSA effects emerge independently of cultural backgrounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chen et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Köhler, 1929;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Oberman &amp; Ramachandran, 2008)</ref>. In the present context, this result excludes cultural differences as a possible alternative explanation for the absence of SSAs in the CC, DC, and CB individuals assessed in India.</p><p>In conclusion, the present results suggest that the development and stabilization of audiovisual as well as audiohaptic SSAs in humans depend on high-level vision over a protracted postnatal developmental period. At the same time, we provided evidence that prolonged blindness with an onset after this sensitive period fails to abolish SSAs, demonstrating the other side of the coin of sensitive periods, that is, the robustness of representations acquired during the sensitive period against loss.</p></div>
