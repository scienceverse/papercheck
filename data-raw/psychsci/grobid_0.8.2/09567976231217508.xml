<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This article has been revised and republished following identification of a coding error that affected some of the results of the original article, as published on January 9, 2019.</p><p>The article was revised after nonauthor colleagues noticed an error in the publicly available analysis code (<ref type="url" target="https://osf.io/gkw6c/">https://osf.io/gkw6c/</ref>); this error resulted in incorrect assignment of trials to conditions and/or omission of some trials from inclusion in choice analyses. This mis-assignment of trials to conditions affected the statistics associated with the percentages of disciplined vs. indulgent choices associated with common-disciplined and commonindulgent trials; those analyses are now corrected in this version. The authors verified that other analyses (i.e., decision weights, gaze fixations, and simulations) were not affected by coding errors.</p><p>Due to the extensive updates required, the article has been revised and republished. The revised article was reviewed by the current Editor-in-Chief of Psychological Science, the Chair of the APS Publications Committee, and the original action editor on the manuscript; all have approved this republished version.</p></div>
