<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>body of theoretical and empirical work in cultural evolution emphasizes that our species is fundamentally cultural, and thus, these cultural differences are also psychological differences: from norms and attitudes, to the degree to which these norms are enforced, to lowlevel perception of color and visual illusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Boyd, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Gelfand, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Henrich, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Just how psychologically different are the nations of the world compared with each other and with the overscrutinized United States? Many hard drives have been filled with the ways in which China and Japan differ from the United States and Canada, but just how psychologically distant is the culture of China from Japan, the United States from Canada, or Azerbaijan from Zambia? Here, we introduce a robust method for quantifying this distance. This method allows us to develop scales of cultural distance, and therefore cross-cultural psychological distance, 1 by selecting any population as a point of comparison. Because psychological data remain largely American <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Rad et al., 2018)</ref>, we developed an American scale of cultural distance from the United States as an example. As a point of comparison, we also developed a Chinese scale of cultural distance from China, the largest population on Earth and a common cultural comparison. Using our R code or online tool (<ref type="url" target="http://www.culturaldistance.com">www.culturaldistance.com</ref>), researchers can create scales of cultural distance with any comparison population, which will become increasingly important as the literature becomes less WEIRD.</p><p>The measurement of cross-cultural psychological differences and cultural distances has a long history. Apart from the many differences identified by cultural psychologists <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Heine, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Henrich et al., 2010)</ref>, notable attempts to quantify these differences include <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Hofstede's (2001)</ref> cultural dimensions, <ref type="bibr">Inglehart and Welzel's (2005)</ref> cultural map, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Schwartz's (2006)</ref> values. These difference measures are sometimes combined and used as distance measures. Notable examples include <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Kogut and Singh's (1988)</ref> composite measure of Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions and <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Demes and Geeraert's (2014)</ref> scale of perceived cultural distance. Within economics and political science, genetic distance and linguistic distance are often used as proxies for cultural distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Desmet, Ortuño-Ortín, &amp; Wacziarg, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Gorodnichenko &amp; Roland, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Spolaore &amp; Wacziarg, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>These approaches are widely used but have various limitations. For example, the values-and-dimensions approach characteristic of <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Hofstede (2001)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Inglehart and Welzel (2005)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Schwartz (2006)</ref> focuses on identifying the values or dimensions along which groups differ, focusing on cultural differences rather than cultural distance. Moreover, these values represent mean differences, largely ignoring differences in variance or frequencies of beliefs and behaviors-bimodal or multimodal populations appear the same if they have the same mean. For example, Brazil and Turkey have almost identical scores along Hofstede's Individualism dimension <ref type="bibr">(38 and 37, respectively)</ref>. Indeed, Brazil and Turkey look very similar along most Hofstede dimensions (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Brazil and Turkey differ in a variety of ways; however, overall, Brazil has greater variability in beliefs and values than Turkey (variance in beliefs is sometimes measured as "looseness," or tolerance for deviant behavior; Brazil and Turkey are on opposite ends of this spectrum; <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Gelfand et al., 2011)</ref>. But looseness, too, is a point estimate-cultural traits vary by domain, even if some nations tend to be tighter or looser overall. And when it comes to nominal cultural traits, such as whether a participant's political priorities are to give people more to say, maintain order in the nation, fight rising prices, or protect freedom of speech, neither mean nor variance captures the relative frequencies.</p><p>Here, we present the cultural fixation index (CF ST ), a measure built on the fixation index (F ST ) measure from population biology <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Bell, Richerson, &amp; McElreath, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Cavalli-Sforza, Menozzi, &amp; Piazza, 1994)</ref>, as a tool for measuring cultural distance. The CF ST is robust and theoretically defensible. It can be used as a high-resolution method to identify regional, national, or arbitrary cultural groupings (such as class differences). It can also be used to identify the distance between two groups on the basis of an aggregate of many cultural dimensions or along any arbitrary dimensions, such as politics or social relations, depending on the theory being tested <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Muthukrishna &amp; Henrich, 2019)</ref>. We first discuss the technique and then use it to construct example scales of cultural distance that can guide researchers in deciding where to target their data-collection efforts. To make it easy for researchers to use this method, we have made the R code available and developed an online tool (<ref type="url" target="http://www.culturaldistance.com">www  .culturaldistance.com</ref>). The online tool allows researchers to explore particular dimensions of difference, and future versions of the tool will allow comparisons at the regional level. A guide to using the online tool can be found in the Supplemental Material available online.</p><p>The F ST is theoretically meaningful within evolution because it measures how genotype frequencies for each subpopulation differ from expectations if there were random mating over the entire population; that is, it measures the degree to which the populations can be considered structured and separate. For cultural inheritance, this is directly analogous to between-group differentiation caused by selection, migration, and social-learning mechanisms. Thus, insofar as one advocates a formal theoretical approach to psychological research <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Muthukrishna &amp; Henrich, 2019)</ref> and insofar as cultural evolution offers a compelling explanation for cultural change, F ST offers a theoretically informed approach to measuring cultural distance with a long and established history within the broader evolutionary sciences. We discuss this in more detail, and compare the F ST with other methods, in the Supplemental Material.</p><p>We begin by comparing the CF ST with other common approaches to measuring cultural distance. We then formally describe the CF ST statistic and how we used it to develop the American and Chinese scales. We demonstrate the robustness of the scales to missing or incomplete data and show how it can also be used to study cultural variation within a population, using regional variation as an example. Finally, we show the relationship between these scales and other measures of cultural distance, and we discuss tests of how well they predict common or high-profile measures of crosscultural psychological differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>One approach to measuring cultural distance is to turn multiple difference measures, such as Hofstede's cultural dimensions, into a distance measure by taking a weighted mean of the distance between a country's values on the difference scale. The most popular of these composite measures is the formulation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Kogut and Singh (1988)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">CD I I V d cj i d ij ic i = - = ∑         1 2 ( ) / ,</formula><p>where cultural distance CD between country c and country j is the mean over all dimensions d of the squared difference between the countries' cultural difference value I for dimension i weighted by the variance V of that dimension i. This method allows researchers to turn these differences into a composite distance measure that captures a distance between countries on Hofstede's cultural dimensions. However, it suffers the same limitations as the underlying difference measures, such as focusing on mean differences between countries and ignoring differences in variance or frequencies (the variance above is the variance of the index across countries, not variance in culture within the country). Brazil and Turkey still look culturally close because they have similar mean culturaldifference values along most dimensions.</p><p>Another approach, as exemplified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Demes and Geeraert (2014)</ref>, is to develop a scale that asks participants to compare countries on perceived cultural distance along dimensions such as climate, food and eating, and values and beliefs. This is similar to how any psychometric scale is developed but is a measure of the perception of participants from country A about country B. This approach may be a good measure of perceptions of culture but may be limited by the knowledge of participants from country A about participants from country B. Here, we use the World Values Survey (WVS) as a measure of what people report that they do and believe.</p><p>Genetic distance and linguistic distance do not share these limitations; instead, they serve as an overall proxy measure of cultural distance between any two nations. But because they do not measure culture directly, they can be misleading. For example, Hong Kong is greater than an order of magnitude more genetically similar to China (F ST = 9.59 × 10 -4 ) than to Great Britain (F ST = 3.96 × 10 -2 ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Pemberton, DeGiorgio, &amp; Rosenberg, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Spolaore &amp; Wacziarg, 2018)</ref> but is culturally similar to both countries because of Britain's century-long history in Hong Kong. Linguistic distance is a better measure of cultural distance-language is a core aspect of culture, and the lack of a common language can culturally isolate groups-but the resolution of language distance makes it difficult to distinguish the cultures of Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, all of whose populations speak English. These differences drive tourism and migration but are largely invisible on a language family tree. None of these measures serve as a robust and defensible cultural-distance scale that can be used to compare two sampled populations, an important tool given the stark psychological differences between cultural groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Henrich et al., 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fixation index (F ST )</head><p>F ST <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1994</ref>) is a method used to calculate the size of the genetic differences (genetic distance) between two populations. In the genetic case, F ST represents the ratio of the between-and withingroups variance of alleles (such as gene variants for blue or brown eyes) at a particular locus (such as the DNA location for the main eye-color gene) in the genomes of individuals in two populations. Formally,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F ST is equal to σ σ g T 2 2</formula><p>, where σ g 2 is the variance of allele frequency between populations, and σ T 2 is the variance of allele frequency in the total population. In practice, F ST is calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">H H H T g T -</formula><p>, where H T is the average number of pairwise differences in alleles (for genetic distance) or answers (for cultural distance) between individuals drawn from the total population (both populations), and H g is the average number of pairwise differences in alleles or answers between two individuals from the same population. If these pairwise differences are the same, F ST = 0, the populations are identical. If the two equal-size populations are more homogeneous but different, we get the maximum distance, F ST = 1 (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Like a correlation coefficient, F ST is also a nonlinear metric. This means that the numbers are meaningful for comparisons, but an F ST of .6 is not twice as large as an F ST of .3-just as a correlation (r) of .6 is not twice as high a correlation as .3.</p><p>To get an overall genetic distance between two populations, one can aggregate the F ST values for allele frequencies across all loci or some subset loci of interest in the genome of a representative sample of each population. The availability of large, representative, cross-national surveys of cultural values has allowed the same technique to be applied to culture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of the CF ST</head><p>The CF ST is calculated in the same manner as the genetic F ST , but instead of a genome, we use a large survey of cultural values as a "culturome," with questions treated as loci and answers treated as alleles. Note that, strictly speaking, the answers to such questions are phenotypes-that is, responses are based on a combination of culture, genes, personal experience, and perhaps other inheritance systems <ref type="bibr">(epigenetics, microbiota, etc.;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Laland, 2017)</ref>. This does not affect use for scales of cultural distance, and arguably, what we are really interested in are these expressed phenotypic differences. The CF ST allows us to flexibly quantify the overall size of cultural differences (cultural distance). In contrast to many other</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">F ST = 1 F ST = .11</formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">F ST = 0 Population 1 Population 2 Case 3 C ase 2</formula><p>Case 1</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Three scores on the fixation index (F ST ) calculated along a single dimension with two options-yes (Y) or no (X). In Case 3, the cultural distance between the two populations is 0 because 50% of both populations answered yes (or no). In Case 2, the F ST is .11. Finally, in Case 1, the populations are maximally different because all individuals in Population 1 answered no, and all individuals in Population 2 answered yes. Calculations for each of these cases can be found in the Supplemental Material available online. For the two populations, we calculated the mean F ST along all cultural questions or along specific questions of interest (such as those mapping onto a particular dimension).</p><p>measures of cultural differences, the CF ST compares distributions rather than point estimates (not simply that one group has a higher mean than another), does not assume homogeneity in groups (instead looking at the frequencies of cultural traits), and does not assume that traits fall along a single dimension (instead, individuals can be higher or lower along related continuous cultural traits or have a range of discrete, orthogonal cultural traits). Moreover, the CF ST can handle continuous, binary, or nominal traits. By calculating CF ST scores for subsets of questions, we can also see how nations differ along different dimensions. For example, a family-values dimension might include questions on the importance of family, respect for parents, parents' duty toward their children, and the various values that parents wish to instill in their children. These dimensions may be predetermined (similar to including all genes associated with height or skin color) or based on dimension-reduction techniques. A list of predetermined dimensions and statistically reduced dimensions can be found in the Data section. Researchers can examine predetermined dimensions at <ref type="url" target="http://www.culturaldistance.com">www.cultur  aldistance.com</ref>. Of course, the use of particular dimensions should be theoretically motivated (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Muthukrishna &amp; Henrich, 2019)</ref>, and so here we use an aggregate measure to demonstrate the use of the CF ST . The CF ST can also be calculated between regions within larger nations; nations are not equally heterogeneous. Such within-countries variation is important for assessing generalizability.</p><p>Using this common currency, we can apply several visualization techniques commonly used in bioinformatics, such as neighbor joining to cluster countries that are most similar, multidimensional scaling plots to visualize diversity within a nation or identify "cultural continents," and density plots to investigate subdimensions or questions within subdimensions (see examples in the Supplemental Material). Moreover, we can calculate confidence intervals (CIs) as a measure of uncertainty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formal description of the CF ST</head><p>The CF ST can be computed for any measured trait as long as there are data measured at an individual level and we know the group or groups to which the individual belongs. The data can be continuous (quantitative, cardinal, ordinal) or categorical (nominal). The CF ST is computed for a particular trait. To calculate the CF ST between groups, we can use the mean CF ST across all traits for an overall distance measure or all traits of interest for a particular domain or dimension. When measuring genetic distance, one could measure overall genetic distance or only the distance for loci associated with a particular disease or associated with a physical trait, such as height. Similarly, for the CF ST , we might be interested only in traits associated with prosociality, sexual attitudes, or political positions. Focusing on specific dimensions may be important for particular research questions driven by a particular theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Muthukrishna &amp; Henrich, 2019)</ref>, but because we have no particular theoretical basis for examining subdimensions, here we focus on overall cultural distance as a demonstration. We begin by explaining the CF ST formula, starting with continuous data, which is more straightforward and should be more familiar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Continuous data.</head><p>As discussed, at its core, the CF ST is the ratio of the between-group variance (σ g 2 ) and total variance (σ T 2 ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">CF ST g T = σ σ 2 2 .</formula><p>We can use standard ways of computing a statistical variance when dealing with quantitative characters and, in some cases, cardinal and ordinal data. The variance for the whole population is taken by summing the data from all individuals in the population:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">σ - - T i s j n ij i x x N 2 1 1 2 1 = = = ∑ ∑ ( ) ,</formula><p>where x ij is the quantitative measure of an observation from individual j in group i, n i is the number of individuals in group i (with sample size s), xis the mean trait value summed across all individuals in the population, and N = Σ i i n . Similarly, the variance between groups σ g 2 can be computed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">i s i x x s = ∑ - - 1 2 1 ( )</formula><p>, where</p><p>x i is the mean quantitative trait value in group i.</p><p>Categorical data. For categorical data, we can adapt the Equation 4 formula in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.10.1 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Cavalli-Sforza et al. (1994)</ref>. For a question or loci with L number of outcomes and p ki as the frequency of outcome (e.g., answer) k in group i, we can compute the CF ST for a particular observation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">CF p p p ST k k k k , ( ) , = var( ) 1 - where p n p n k i S i ki i S i = ∑ ∑ = = 1 1</formula><p>is the average allele frequency across s populations weighted by sample size (n i ), and</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">var(p k ) = - - = Σ i S ki k p p s 1 2 1 ( ) )</formula><p>is the between-group variance in observed frequencies of answers. This specification gives us the deviations from the mean trait frequency across all groups. Across all questions, the CF ST is</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">∑ - ∑ - = = k L k k ST k k L k k p p CF p p 1 1 1 1 ( ) ( ) .</formula><p>,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data</head><p>Cultural distance is calculated using combined data from the two most recent waves of the WVS <ref type="bibr">(2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">-2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">and 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">-2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Inglehart et al., 2014)</ref>. These waves contain answers from 170,247 participants gathered from nationally representative samples of 80 countries where approximately 85% of the world's population lives. We included values, beliefs, and behaviors that we judged as culturally transmissible, largely similar to those selected by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Bell et al. (2009)</ref>, but excluded questions that were specific to a region (e.g., confidence in the North American Free Trade Agreement); Bell and colleagues compared only neighboring countries within the same region, so were able to include these. We also excluded all demographic questions (e.g., age, sex). A full list of our inclusion and exclusion decisions for all WVS questions is available in the Supplemental Material. We used the CF ST to develop an American scale of cultural distance from the United States and a Chinese scale of cultural distance from China. We compared these scales with the following cultural differences, psychological outcomes, and distance measures.</p><p>Hofstede's cultural dimensions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Hofstede's (2001)</ref> cultural dimensions were originally based on surveys of IBM staff collected between 1967 and 1973. The original dimensions included Collectivism-Individualism, Power Distance, Femininity-Masculinity, and Uncertainty Avoidance. Two additional dimensions, Long-Term Orientation and Indulgence, were added later. <ref type="bibr">Hofstede (n.d.)</ref> offers the following descriptions on his website: Individualism is the extent to which people feel independent, as opposed to being interdependent as members of larger wholes. Power Distance is the extent to which the less powerful members of organizations and institutions (such as the family) accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. Masculinity is the extent to which the use of force [is] endorsed socially. Uncertainty Avoidance deals with a society's tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity. Long-Term Orientation deals with change. In a longtime-oriented culture, the basic notion about the world is that it is in flux, and preparing for the future is always needed. In a short-[term]-oriented culture, the world is essentially as it was created, so that the past provides a moral compass, and adhering to it is morally good. Indulgence is about the good things in life. In an indulgent culture, it is good to be free. Doing what your impulses want you to do, is good. Friends are important and life makes sense. In a restrained culture, the feeling is that life is hard, and duty, not freedom, is the normal state of being. (<ref type="url" target="https://geerthofstede.com/culture-geert-hofstede-gert-jan-hofstede/6d-model-of-national-culture/">https://geerthofstede.com/culture-geert-hofstede- gert-jan-hofstede/6d-model-of-national-culture/</ref>) Tightness-looseness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Gelfand et al. (2011)</ref> described tight societies as having many strong norms and a low tolerance for deviant behavior. In contrast, loose societies are characterized as having weak social norms and a high tolerance for deviant behavior. Gelfand et al. measured tightness on the basis of perceptions of social norms and norm enforcement using a survey that includes questions such as "There are many social norms that people are supposed to abide by in this country," and "In this country, if someone acts in an inappropriate way, others will strongly disapprove."</p><p>More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Uz (2015)</ref> has suggested measuring tightness-looseness on the basis of its outcomegreater variance or standard deviation in professed cultural values. Uz introduced three standard-deviation measures of answers in the 2000 wave of the WVS.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Answers as alleles.</head><p>The WVS contains various answer types, including Likert-type scales, binary approve/disapprove responses, and categorical responses. Societies have markedly different answering styles <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Chen, Lee, &amp; Stevenson, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Heine, Lehman, Peng, &amp; Greenholtz, 2002)</ref>. There are also issues with using Likert-type scales crossculturally for a variety of reasons, including cross-cultural differences in preferences for yes/no answers versus a Likert-type scale rating (for discussion and a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Hruschka, Munira, Jesmin, Hackman, &amp; Tiokhin, 2018)</ref>. To reduce the possibility that differences in answer distributions were due to differences in answering style rather than the actual belief or behavior of interest, we split and collapsed valenced questions into positive or negative values akin to alleles (e.g., very important and rather important were combined and not very important and not at all important were combined; if a midpoint existed, it was treated as a separate response). This avoided differences in answering styles masking true differences in beliefs, values, and behaviors and was conservative in collapsing graded differences and showing only opposite beliefs or behaviors. That is, larger distances may exist because of the extent of a belief or behavior-for example, both country A and country B may be more liberal but country A even more so. Unfortunately, we cannot distinguish this from a tendency for people from country A to answer more extremely. The distance we show here represents opposite beliefs and behaviors-for example, country A is more liberal, and country B is more conservative.</p><p>Nominal responses such as religious classification ("a religious person," "not a religious person," "a convinced atheist") were treated akin to separate "alleles." We discuss this in more detail below. Moreover, some ordinal questions had very few responses for a particular option.</p><p>Our decision strategy was as follows. First, we changed all valence questions to a positive allele and a negative allele. A midpoint was coded as a third allele. For example, answers options for the question "Indicate how important it is in your life: Family" were very important, rather important, not very important, and not at all important. These were condensed to two cultural alleles: Allele 1 consisted of very important and rather important, and Allele 2 consisted of not very important and not at all important. Another example is the question, "To fully develop your talents, you need to have a job," which had answer options of strongly agree, agree, neither, disagree, and strongly disagree. These were condensed to three alleles-one for each valence and one for the midpoint: Allele 1 consisted of strongly agree and agree, Allele 2 consisted of disagree and strongly disagree, and Allele 3 consisted of neither.</p><p>Second, we restricted this breakdown to a maximum of four alleles, combining multiple answers on the basis of overall distributions of responses. For examples, the answer options for the question "Apart from weddings and funerals, about how often do you attend religious services these days?" were more than once a week, once a week, once a month, only holy days, once a year, less often, and never (the wording was changed slightly between waves). These were condensed to four alleles: Allele 1 consisted of more than once a week and once a week, Allele 2 consisted of once a month and only holy days, Allele 3 consisted of once a year and less often, and Allele 4 consisted of never. (A full list of allele categorizations is available in the file "alleledimension-data.csv" in the Supplemental Material.)</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>American scale and Chinese scale</head><p>We constructed an American scale by calculating the cultural distance for all countries relative to the United States, the most overrepresented country in psychological research by a wide margin <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Henrich et al., 2010)</ref>. As a point of comparison and to reinforce the point that cultural distances do not unidimensionally range from WEIRD to non-WEIRD, we also constructed a Chinese scale by calculating the cultural distance for all countries relative to China, a common cultural comparison in cultural psychology.</p><p>Because the CF ST is a composite of many questions, we effectively cut a line through a large multidimensional culture space and looked only at the distance from a particular point (the United States in the American scale, China in the Chinese scale). Thus, Japan and Norway are similarly culturally distant from the United States (.115 and .124, respectively) but are not necessarily similar to each other, just as Colombia and the United Kingdom are similarly geographically distant from the United States but nowhere near each other. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> contains the values of the American scale and Chinese scale of cultural distance, which are also graphed on a map in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> and on number lines in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> (note that the most commonly studied non-Western nations-Japan, Hong Kong, and China-are by no means the extreme on the American scale). <ref type="bibr">Figures S1 and S2</ref> show the American scale and Chinese scale number lines, respectively, with 95% CIs shaded in blue. Further emphasizing that cultural distances are distances in a large multidimensional culture space, Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows a 2-D plot of distance from both the United States and China. The plot reveals that many countries are close to neither the United States nor China (and are not necessarily culturally close to each other). For example, Sweden and Colombia are similarly distant from both the United States (CF ST scores = .115 and .102, respectively) and China (CF ST scores = .186 Table 1. (continued)</p><p>and .182, respectively), but they are not culturally close to each other (indeed, they are very different; CF ST score = .261). But here, too, bear in mind that countries close to each other on this plot are not necessarily culturally close to each other; any low-dimensional plot will necessarily collapse the distances in the large multidimensional culture space.</p><p>Recent research <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Klein et al., 2018)</ref> suggests that researchers may also wish to have a proxy for a WEIRD scale. The American scale may serve as a proxy for a WEIRD scale, given that American samples dominate psychological research. However, as the American scale reveals, there is considerable distance between different nations that may all be classified as WEIRD (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and <ref type="table">Figs. 3</ref> and <ref type="table">4</ref>). Moreover, there is a high but imperfect correlation between scales constructed with distance from different WEIRD nations (e.g., American scale correlation with Canadian scale: r = .94, p &lt; .001; Australian scale: r = .89, p &lt; .001; New Zealand scale: r = .86, p &lt; .001; and British scale: r = .83, p &lt; .001). Whenever possible, we encourage researchers to look at the distance between specific samples or even between participants at a national or regional level. For example, conducting studies to test generalizability or explain anticipated cultural variation from U.S. studies will be less powerful if done in Australia compared with Yemen, but generalizing a study conducted in Turkey will be less powerful if done in Yemen compared with Australia.</p><p>To make it easy to quickly calculate the cultural distance between any two nations, we have provided CF ST Value CF ST Value Fig. 4.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Robustness tests</head><p>We investigated the robustness of the CF ST by randomly resampling a fixed proportion of the question set and comparing these values with the full question set. We did this 10,000 times for each proportion value and then (a) counted the number of times a value fell outside the CI calculated on all questions and (b) recorded the size of the deviation from the CF ST value calculated on all questions for two different measures of robustness. For the purposes of the American scale, we did this for all countries relative to the United States. For the Chinese scale, we did the same with all countries relative to China. We plot these in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref>.</p><p>These analyses show that the CF ST is highly robust. We can sample up to only 50% of questions and still get only small deviations (.013 and .026 from the United States and China, respectively) and values that remain highly correlated with the original scale by both Pearson correlation (rs = .95 and .87 from the United States and China, respectively) and Spearman correlation (rs = .95 and .85 from the United States and China, respectively). When we sample by values instead of entire questions, deviations are smaller still. This robustness, even to losing entire questions, is not so surprising when you consider that culture tends to cluster <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Harton &amp; Bullock, 2007)</ref> because of cultural transmission mechanisms such as common sources of information and the conformist bias in cultural learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Chudek, Muthukrishna, &amp; Henrich, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Henrich, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Muthukrishna, Morgan, &amp; Henrich, 2016)</ref>. Thus, the CF ST will be robust even if we do not ask every conceivable question, as long as we have a variety of questions that capture a variety of cultural traits (the correlation between cultural traits is not perfect). To this end, the WVS is an ideal survey for creating scales of cultural distance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison with other measured psychological and cultural differences</head><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>, we compare the American scale and Chinese scale with other commonly used measures of psychological and cultural differences. For the difference measures, we report the correlation with the raw value and also subtract each country's score from the score for the United States and China, respectively (labeled "relative"). For the distance scores, we compare the distance from the United States and China, respectively. We plot these correlations visually in Figure <ref type="figure">S4</ref> in the Supplemental Material.</p><p>These correlations reveal that the American scale predicts many more cross-cultural differences in psychology than the Chinese scale. Remarkably, many of these correlations are large and significant even when we correlated the raw values of the various measures. This suggests that WEIRD societies, as typified by the United States, are truly odd outliers in human psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Schulz et al., 2019)</ref>. Another nonexclusive possibility is that researchers from WEIRD countries have focused their data-gathering efforts on psychological dimensions that they find odd in comparison with Western psychology. Long-Term Orientation, a new addition to Hofstede's cultural dimensions, is a nice illustration of a trait for which China, rather than the United States, is the outlier. If psychology were dominated by China, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> would have perhaps been dominated by dimensions that Chinese researchers found to be different in other parts of the world, and the Chinese scale, rather than the American scale, would consequently be more predictive of differences.</p><p>It is reassuring that, in contrast to these psychological differences, the proxies for cultural distancegeographic, linguistic, and genetic-although weakly correlated, are predictive of cultural distance from both the United States and China and not just the United States. Together, these correlations suggest that (a) we are measuring an overall cultural distance-a strength of the CF ST approach, (b) an American scale is predictive of various psychological variables, and (c) the United States is unique either as a psychological outlier or because of what the United States and other WEIRD researchers have chosen to study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Hofstede's (2001)</ref> Individualism dimension is perhaps the dimension most often used and cited across the social sciences. It has the highest correlation with the American scale of cultural distance, with more collectivist societies further away from the United States. The next most commonly used and cited cultural dimension is probably Power Distance, which has the second highest correlation with the American scale. Societies with a larger power distance are more culturally distant to the United States. The only other measure with a reasonably large correlation with the American scale is Indulgence, for which societies that have more emphasis on individual freedom are more culturally similar to the United States. These correlations match U.S. stereotypes that emphasize equality and individual 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 Proportion Sampled Pearson Correlation United States -0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 Proportion Sampled Spearman Correlation United States 0.990 0.995 1.000 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 Proportion Sampled Pearson Correlation United States 0.980 0.985 0.990 0.995 1.000 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 Proportion Sampled Spearman Correlation United States  Table 2. (continued)</p><p>freedom. The American scale has a smaller correlation with Long-Term Orientation, for which societies with more focus on the future are more culturally similar to the United States. The Chinese scale correlates with only Long-Term Orientation and perhaps Indulgence. These results may suggest that these dimensions largely emphasize cultural differences in psychology that look remarkable from a WEIRD standpoint but perhaps not from the standpoints of other societies. The tightness-looseness scale developed by Gelfand (2011) has a moderate correlation with the American scale-tighter societies are more culturally distant from the United States, but there are several outliers. In contrast, the <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Uz (2015)</ref> measure is strongly correlated with the American scale of cultural distance, with tighter societies being more culturally distant from the United States. However, with the possible exception of the domain-general Uz measure, tightness-looseness does not reliably correlate with the Chinese scale. This suggests that internal cultural variation or tolerance for deviation may be distinct features of the United Statesremarkable from a WEIRD standpoint but not representative of the world. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Schwartz's (2006)</ref> values of embeddedness and autonomy correlate with the American scale, as may harmony and hierarchy. These correlations mirror the correlation with Hofstede's Individualism and Indulgence dimensions. The correlations with the Chinese scale are more unreliable, although there may be a relationship with embeddedness, egalitarianism, and autonomy, suggesting that China may be an extreme on these dimensions.</p><p>Extraversion, Agreeableness, and perhaps Openness correlated with the American scale, again suggesting that the United States is an outlier on these dimensions. None of the personality factors reliably correlate with the Chinese scale. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">McCrae et al. (2005)</ref> noted that Western nations tend to have larger variance across personality traits, which is borne out by the correlation with the American scale but not the Chinese scale. This may fit with greater latitude for self-expression in WEIRD societies.</p><p>WEIRD nations are outliers on creativity, altruism, obedience, and corruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Schulz et al., 2019)</ref>. In contrast, the Chinese scale correlates with obedience and blood donations but not with the other psychological outcomes.</p><p>All distance measures show weak to moderate correlations with the American scale. With the exception of the traditional <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Kogut-Singh (1988)</ref> scale and the language-distance scale, most measures also correlate with the Chinese scale. The traditional Kogut-Singh scale derived from the original four Hofstede dimensions does not correlate with the Chinese scale, but the addition of the two variables that correlate with the Chinese scale increases the correlation. These correlations are reassuring in showing that the CF ST approach to measuring cultural distance correlates in the right direction, with fewer high-resolution measures of cultural distance. The relationship between linguistic distance and the American scale was inconsistent, although the plots make clear that there is a huge amount of variance. Many countries with linguistic similarity are quite culturally distant and vice versa. Both genetic measures suggest a fairly modest correlation with our American scale. Such a low value is problematic given the common usage of genetic distance as a proxy for cultural distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Gorodnichenko &amp; Roland, 2017)</ref> but is consistent with that found by other researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Giuliano, Spilimbergo, &amp; Tonon, 2013)</ref>, who argued that genetic distance captures geography but not culture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The psychological sciences face multiple crises, one of which is their overreliance on samples from WEIRD nations and on samples from the United States in particular <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Henrich et al., 2010)</ref>. A more general theory of human behavior requires a theoretical and empirical understanding of humans across the globe and across the life span. We present a cultural-distance metric based on the F ST technique from population genetics, applied to the WVS, a large survey of cultural values. CF ST is a theoretically defensible and robust method of measuring cultural distance, grounded in evolutionary theory. It considers differences between distributions of cultural traits rather than point estimates or arbitrary dimensions. This approach has proven useful in answering questions in anthropology and economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Bell et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Desmet et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Spolaore &amp; Wacziarg, 2018)</ref>. We anticipate that it will be equally useful to psychologists in addressing the WEIRD people problem.</p><p>To this end, we used the CF ST to develop an American scale of cultural distance from the United States and a Chinese scale of cultural distance from China. CF ST values can range from 0 to 1, yet all values on both scales are less than .3. This is consistent with findings of past research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Saucier et al., 2015)</ref> showing that we have more in common across cultures than we have differences. Yet just as only 4% of our genes separate us from chimpanzees, those differences can be important and predictive.</p><p>The American scale correlates with many documented cross-cultural psychological differences, but the Chinese scale is far less predictive. Remarkably, the American scale correlates even with the raw scores of these various measures. Together, these results suggest that WEIRD nations are truly psychological outliers in some objective sense, as has been recently argued <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Schulz et al., 2019)</ref>. Alternatively, although not mutually exclusively, it could be that these psychological measures have been studied because they are remarkable to researchers from WEIRD countries or remarkable because of how they differ from other nations. That is, if psychology were dominated by Chinese psychologists, we would see a different set of psychological outcomes covered in textbooks, and these psychologies would correlate with a Chinese scale. Resolving which of these explanations is correct will require greater diversity in both researchers and samples.</p><p>Reassuringly, both the American scale and the Chinese scale correlate with proxies of cultural distance, suggesting that the scales are capturing some true cultural distance. In contrast, the original <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Kogut-Singh (1988)</ref> distance is predictive only of the American scale. The addition of new dimensions with strong correlations to the Chinese scale improves the correlation with both the WEIRD and Chinese scales. We argue that by capturing only mean differences and ignoring differences in distributions, this alternative approach is systematically misleading.</p><p>The CF ST (which has been made available through R code and at <ref type="url" target="http://www.culturaldistance.com">www.culturaldistance.com</ref>) allows researchers to measure cultural distance between any two countries. The technique may also be used to explore cultural differences between regions within countries, between social classes, between age groups, or between any other grouping. We used this flexibility to compare the cultural differences between regions within the four largest populations-China, India, the United States, and the European Union. These analyses reveal that the cultural differences between regions of the overscrutinized United States are considerably smaller than those of the European Union, China, or India.</p><p>Researchers may disagree with our various decisions in constructing these scales. For example, we conservatively removed much of the variance in the degree to which societies agree or disagree on a cultural trait. We removed these to reduce concerns around response biases (see the Answers as Alleles section), but other researchers may wish to include the full extent of this variance. Similarly, other researchers may wish to use a different set of questions that they believe are more defensible as culturally transmissible (see included-variables.csv in the Supplemental Material) or even argue that a different statistic is more appropriate (see Section 2 in the Supplemental Material). And indeed, biases may exist in the questions chosen for the WVS itself. We hope that the code we have provided and the transparency of our decisions aid in extending this research beyond these limitations.</p><p>We hope that this technique and tool may guide researchers in selecting sites and samples that are sufficiently culturally different to test the generalizability of their hypotheses. For example, the Far East has always held a certain exoticism for people from the West, which may have driven a generation of cultural psychologists to document the many ways in which East Asian societies differ from the West. However, as Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> illustrates, the most extensively researched East Asian nations-Japan, Hong Kong, and China (marked with asterisks)-are not anywhere near the extreme on the American scale, and some are barely halfway. Moreover, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6</ref>, there is considerable diversity within China, let alone among China, Japan, and Hong Kong. This diversity has been exploited by some researchers, for example, showing the role of agriculture on individualism and collectivism within China <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Talhelm et al., 2014)</ref>. But we know far less about psychological differences within countries beyond the United States, where we know state-by-state differences in psychological traits such as tightness-looseness <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Harrington &amp; Gelfand, 2014)</ref>. We hope that researchers find the CF ST technique, toolkit, and American scale useful not only for generalizing their findings but also for developing theories to explain cross-cultural differences between and within nations. With such theories, it may also make more sense to use dimensions of cultural distances rather than an aggregate scale, but we emphasize the need for this investigation to be theoretically driven <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Muthukrishna &amp; Henrich, 2019)</ref>. In the Supplemental Material, we offer some suggestions for developing these dimensions.</p><p>Relatively little attention has been paid to the Middle East and Africa by both the WVS (see gray regions in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) and the psychological sciences more generally. However, given the relative cultural distance from the United States and Africa's large genetic <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Ramachandran et al., 2005)</ref>, linguistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Atkinson, 2011)</ref>, and likely cultural variation, we have every reason to suspect that the American scale will continue to stretch as we map out these psychological terrae incognitae. These regions, as well as other underrepresented regions such as the South Pacific, may in fact hold a treasure trove of findings for the next wave of cultural psychologists. And as our results illustrate, this may not only shape the breadth of existing psychological outcomes but also lead to questions we have not even thought to ask, new psychologies, and new ways of organizing psychology. Thus, what we know so far may represent the tip of the iceberg of a more fully fledged picture of the human psyche.</p></div>
