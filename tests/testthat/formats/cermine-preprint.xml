      <p>Envy shapes social hierarchies. To protect their rank, envied persons react to the threat posed
by enviers. Doing so requires that envied persons initially perceive who envies them.
However, a common perspective is that envy lacks a unique expression and that enviers
disguise their experience, preventing the social perception of envy. In contrast to this
perspective, recent evidence indicates that observers perceive benign and malicious forms of
envy accurately when they can integrate information about targets. These findings suggest
that observers infer envy based on multiple, contextual cues. We hypothesized that observers
infer envy from facial and bodily expressions in comparison situations. Specifically,
observers should infer benign envy when a target, who encounters an advantaged person,
turns with disappointment toward the advantage. Conversely, observers should infer
malicious envy when the target turns with anger toward the advantaged person. Three
preregistered studies tested these hypotheses (total N = 693). In Studies 1 and 2, targets turned
with an emotional or neutral expression either toward a person silhouette or a valuable object,
and participants rated targets’ envy. In Study 3, participants performed the same task with
more realistic stimuli. Across studies, emotional display and head turning had independent
effects on inferences of benign and malicious envy. Furthermore, observers inferred envy
more when the target expressed an emotion instead of remaining neutral. We discuss how the
results inform research on the social perception of envy.</p>

        Envy affects many social situations. Every time a person has a desirable personality
characteristic, owns a valuable status object, or reached a notable achievement, others may
react with envy. Being envied is an ambivalent experience
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">(Parrott, 2017)</xref>
        . It implies that the
person attained a publicly recognized position, yet enviers also pose a threat this position.
That is, enviers may try to surpass the person in the future or harm the person’s position
immediately. To soothe the situation or to protect one’s prominent position requires that
envied persons can tell who envies them. Put differently, reacting to others envy, first and
foremost, requires accurate inferences of envy.
      </p>
      <p>
        However previous research mostly reached the conclusion that it should be
impossible for observers to infer another person’s envy. A common perspective is that enviers
typically disguise their experience towards others
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">(Miceli &amp; Castelfranchi, 2007)</xref>
        . In fact,
enviers may disguise their experience to such an extent that they even deny their feelings
towards themselves
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">(Smith &amp; Kim, 2007)</xref>
        . In contrast to these perspectives, people report that
they recognize envy in others
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">(Rodriguez Mosquera et al., 2010)</xref>
        , and recent evidence
indicates that acquainted persons can accurately perceive each other’s dispositional tendency
to experience envy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">(Lange et al., 2020)</xref>
        . Thus, people do seem to believe they know when
others are envious, and their intuitions may be accurate. These findings beg the question as to
which cues lead people to infer that others are envious? Our goal was to investigate nonverbal
cues that foster envy inferences in observers.

      <title>The Social Perception of Envy</title>
      <p>
        Envy results from a painful upward comparison and serves the goal to overcome the
difference between the envier and the envied person
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36 ref45">(Lange et al., 2018; Parrott &amp; Smith,
1993)</xref>
        . Enviers often pursue this goal via hostile means such as undermining envied persons
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(Duffy et al., 2012)</xref>
        or using disparaging labels when talking about successful others
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">(Rentzsch et al., 2015)</xref>
        . Therefore, scholars and the media alike preferably portray envy as
socially undesirable. In line with this notion, a common perspective is that envy is an emotion
that people typically disguise towards others and deny toward themselves
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40 ref62">(Miceli &amp;
Castelfranchi, 2007; Smith &amp; Kim, 2007)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        If enviers conceal their experience, accurately perceiving envy in others should be
challenging. In general, many emotions involve facial, bodily, verbal, or vocal expressions
that, in turn, play a pivotal role in communicating a person’s experience
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19 ref54 ref6 ref77">(Aviezer et al., 2012;
Elfenbein &amp; Ambady, 2002; Sauter et al., 2010; Witkower &amp; Tracy, 2019)</xref>
        . That is, people
express emotions in different ways and observers decode these expressions to infer associated
emotional experiences. For envy, however, research has not yet proposed unique expressions.
Given envy’s socially undesirable character and disguised nature, enviers may simply not
reveal many signs of their experience to observers.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is, however, reason to predict that enviers cannot conceal their envy entirely.
As a starting point, research indicates that envy contributes to the regulation of social
hierarchies
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref23">(Crusius &amp; Lange, 2017; Fiske, 2010)</xref>
        . The desire for social rank is a fundamental
human motive
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(C. Anderson et al., 2015)</xref>
        , and envy serves to level rank differences between
the self and higher-ranked others
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32 ref64 ref65 ref73">(Lange &amp; Crusius, 2015; see also Van de Ven, 2016; Van de
Ven et al., 2009)</xref>
        . An experience sampling study suggests that, to serve this fundamental need,
enviers’ cognitions and motivations following an envy-eliciting event guide their behavior
over multiple days
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">(Lange et al., 2018)</xref>
        . Considering the importance of engaging in action to
overcome painful rank differentials and the temporally extended character of envy, it is likely
that enviers leak cues to their experience at some point in time. Furthermore, the importance
of protecting social rank predicts that higher-ranked persons will be vigilant to perceive cues
to other’s envy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(C. Anderson et al., 2015)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, in line with this reasoning, research indicates that accurate social perception
of envy is possible
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">(Lange et al., 2020)</xref>
        . People’s self-ratings of their dispositional inclination
to react with envy correlated positively with acquainted peers’ perception of people’s
dispositional inclination. Further analyses implied that this correlation could not be explained
by people and peers just being similar to each other and projecting their own personality onto
each other. However, self-ratings of envy in a particular situation were uncorrelated with
unacquainted dyad partners’ perception of people’s experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        These findings imply that others may need to integrate multiple pieces of information
to derive accurate insight in another person’s envy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">(see also Puranik et al., 2019)</xref>
        . Each cue to
a person’s envy considered in isolation is likely ambiguous, as is the case for most emotions
that are considered non-prototypical
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">(Fehr &amp; Russell, 1984)</xref>
        . For instance, the painful
inferiority people experience probably manifests in an expression, yet there is no distinct
expression associated with envy. Moreover, envy may manifest in behaviors such as
criticizing, congratulating, or gossiping, yet none of these behaviors is uniquely associated
with envy. Inferring from such cues that a person is envious necessarily requires taking
contextual information into account (e.g., that the person criticizes someone who is
betteroff). The need to integrate information—to integrate multiple, contextual cues, which each
considered separately are ambiguous—distinguishes envy from many other, primarily
prototypical emotions. For instance, emotions such as anger, sadness, or pride but also
boredom, embarrassment, or shame have unique facial expressions that already in isolation
enable their recognition by observers
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">(Keltner et al., 2019)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, people may not decode envy from a single cue such as a distinct facial
expression, but from a combination of expressive displays and contextual information. When
enviers express several cues in the same situation or when people can observe these cues
across several situations, observers may integrate them and be able to put them together in a
coherent picture. Supporting this idea, in one of the few studies on the social perception of
envy, people judged others to be envious based on multiple, contextual cues, namely when
targets uttered rude comments about a befriended, advantaged person towards an uninvolved
third party
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">(Silver &amp; Sabini, 1978)</xref>
        . In line with the expectation that inferring others’ envy
requires the integration of multiple, contextual cues, evidence implies that envy can occur in
different forms that are partly constituted by different feelings, cognitions, and motivations as
well as manifest in different behaviors. This evidence is where we turn next.

      <title>Inferring Envy</title>
      <p>
        The experience of envy involves changes in several feelings, cognitions, motivations,
and expressive behaviors
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36 ref45 ref9">(e.g., Lange et al., 2018; Parrott &amp; Smith, 1993)</xref>
        . Moreover, theories
on envy argue that envy entails different emotions
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">(Smith, 2004)</xref>
        . In fact, complex emotions
such as envy can involve or be accompanied by basic emotions, particularly if the complex
and basic emotions result from similar appraisals
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43 ref46">(for related arguments see for instance
Oatley &amp; Johnson-Laird, 1987; Plutchik, 1982)</xref>
        . Therefore, the painful experience inherent in
envy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36 ref63">(Lange et al., 2018; Tai et al., 2012)</xref>
        may lead to changes in the face or body, conveyed
via the expression of more basic emotions. Accounting for envy’s complexity,
methodologically diverse research disentangled two qualitatively different manifestations—
benign and malicious envy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref21 ref36 ref41 ref65 ref73">(Falcon, 2015; Lange et al., 2018; Van de Ven et al., 2009; for a
comparison of different perspectives on envy see Crusius et al., 2020)</xref>
        . As both forms of envy
result from different appraisals
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33 ref67 ref71">(Lange et al., 2016; Van de Ven et al., 2012)</xref>
        , they are likely to
share similarities with different more basic emotions, the expression of which may therefore
provide cues observers could use to infer different forms of envy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Benign envy is constituted by feelings, cognitions, and motivations directed at
improving the envier’s position
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36 ref65 ref73">(Lange et al., 2018; Van de Ven et al., 2009)</xref>
        . It manifests in
improvement behaviors such as increased effort in achievement tasks
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32 ref66 ref68 ref71">(Lange &amp; Crusius,
2015; Van de Ven et al., 2011)</xref>
        or risk-taking
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">(Kwon et al., 2017)</xref>
        . Moreover, when
experiencing benign envy, people direct attention equally to the envied person as well as the
envied person’s advantage and focus on means to improve their situation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Crusius &amp; Lange,
2014)</xref>
        . Benign envy results from enviers’ evaluation that they failed to reach a desired
outcome
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36 ref67 ref71">(Lange et al., 2018; Van de Ven et al., 2012)</xref>
        . This appraisal also leads to
disappointment
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">(Van Dijk et al., 1999)</xref>
        . Disappointment is part of the basic sadness emotion
family
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">(e.g., Shaver et al., 1987)</xref>
        and, correspondingly, shares a facial expression with it
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18 ref42 ref45 ref67 ref71">(e.g.,
Ekman, 1993; Niewiadomski &amp; Pelachaud, 2007; Van Doorn et al., 2012)</xref>
        . Hence, in benign
envy situations, enviers may express disappointment and direct attention to the envied person
or the object of their desire, which could serve as cues to their experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Malicious envy is constituted by feelings, cognitions, and motivations directed at
harming the envied person’s position
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36 ref65 ref73">(Lange et al., 2018; Van de Ven et al., 2009)</xref>
        . It
manifests in aggressive behaviors such as withholding money from the envied person
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">(Moyal
et al., 2020)</xref>
        or feeling schadenfreude when the envied person fails
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">(Lange et al., 2018)</xref>
        .
Moreover, when experiencing malicious envy, people direct attention to the envied person at
the expense of the envied person’s advantage
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Crusius &amp; Lange, 2014)</xref>
        . Malicious envy
results from enviers’ evaluation that the successful person’s advantage is undeserved and that
they blame others for the unfavorable rank difference
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65 ref67 ref71 ref73">(Van de Ven et al., 2009, 2012)</xref>
        . These
appraisals also lead to anger
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Ellsworth &amp; Scherer, 2003)</xref>
        , which has a recognizable facial
display
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Elfenbein &amp; Ambady, 2002)</xref>
        . Hence, in malicious envy, enviers may express anger
and direct attention to the envied person, which could serve as cues to their experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The foregoing considerations suggest that the different forms of envy manifest
themselves in different cues in the context of an upward comparison. This is important,
because contextual information shapes which emotions observers infer
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27 ref8">(e.g., Barrett &amp;
Kensinger, 2010; Kayyal et al., 2015)</xref>
        , especially when the emotion implied by the respective
context is a non-basic emotion
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Carroll &amp; Russell, 1996)</xref>
        . That is, expressions of certain
emotions in a particular context may lead observers to infer a different emotion. Investigating
such cues could therefore illuminate the social perception of envy. Following this notion, we
focus on a minimal set of theoretically relevant expressive behaviors in a particular context
that people may use as cues to infer envy.
      </p>

      <title>Cues of Benign and Malicious Envy</title>
      <p>
        Envy always occurs in situations in which a person has an advantage that is widely
regarded as conveying high status. By definition, envy is a response to another person’s
higher quality, achievement, or possession
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">(Parrott &amp; Smith, 1993)</xref>
        , especially when this
advantage is relevant and valuable in the eyes of others
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref23">(Crusius &amp; Lange, 2017; Fiske, 2010)</xref>
        .
As another person’s advantage is the basis of envy, benign and malicious envy similarly result
from it
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36 ref9">(e.g., Lange et al., 2018)</xref>
        . When encountering a disadvantaged person vis-à-vis an
advantaged person, observers may already infer that envy is likely to occur
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">(e.g., Silver &amp;
Sabini, 1978)</xref>
        . Beyond this general contextual information, observers may base their
inferences on enviers’ facial expressions of disappointment or anger together with the
different foci of attention on the envied person or the envied person’s advantage. Research
indeed suggests that observers can make inferences from such cues.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, observers can derive information from people’s facial expressions. Observers
have affective reactions to facial expressions or infer a target’s personal and situational
characteristics from them
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">(Lange et al., 2021; Van Kleef &amp; Côté, in press)</xref>
        . Moreover,
observers use facial expressions to infer the underlying appraisal of the target
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">(Scherer &amp;
Grandjean, 2008)</xref>
        and draw conclusions about the target’s motivation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">(Hareli &amp; Hess, 2010)</xref>
        .
In envy situations, enviers’ disappointment or anger could reveal information about the
envier’s desires to observers. Given that disappointment is associated with a missed positive
outcome
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">(Van Dijk et al., 1999; here the envied person’s advantage)</xref>
        , observers may infer that
the (benign) envier desires the advantage. Conversely, given that anger is associated with
blaming others
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Ellsworth &amp; Scherer, 2003; here the envied person)</xref>
        for an unfair situation,
observers may infer that the (malicious) envier wants to harm the envied person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, observers can also derive information from people’s eye gaze. Where people
direct their attention provides information to observers regarding people’s motivational
orientation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">(Frischen et al., 2007)</xref>
        , also because motivation drives attention allocation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">(Vogt et
al., 2010)</xref>
        . The differential foci on the envied person or the envied person’s advantage may
similarly convey information about enviers’ goals. Benign enviers direct attention equally to
the envied person and the envied person’s advantage
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Crusius &amp; Lange, 2014)</xref>
        . Yet, attention
towards the advantage should signal to observers that the envier has the goal to improve,
leading to inferences of benign envy more than when the envier simultaneously focuses on the
envied person. Malicious enviers direct attention to the envied person more than the envied
person’s advantage
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Crusius &amp; Lange, 2014)</xref>
        . This attentional focus would therefore indicate
to observers that the person’s motivational orientation is directed at the envied person.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hypothesize that observers’ inferences of benign and malicious envy result from
the combination of these two nonverbal cues in the presence of an advantaged person. Indeed,
the recognition of emotional displays improves when the faces’ focus of attention matches the
motivational direction of the emotion
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Adams &amp; Kleck, 2005)</xref>
        . We predict that inferences of
benign envy are more likely when a person looks with disappointment at the successful
person’s advantage. This combined set of cues signals to observers that the person failed to
reach the desired advantage, implying that the envier is motivated to overcome the rank
differential by improving the self. We further predict that inferences of malicious envy are
more likely when a person looks with anger at the envied person. This combined set of cues
signals to observers that the person blames others for an undeserved disadvantage and is
motivated to aggress against the envied person. Thus, we argue that the combination of
nonverbal expressions and contextual information provides cues that lead observers to infer
that a person experiences benign or malicious envy.

      <title>The Current Research</title>
      <p>In most previous theorizing it has been argued that it is impossible for observers to
infer that another person is envious. In contrast, in line with research on the contextualized
nature of emotion perception, we argue that observers can infer benign and malicious envy
from multiple, contextual cues. Specifically, we predict that people infer benign or malicious
envy from a combination of expressive displays and contextual information, namely when a
person encounters an advantaged other person and expresses either disappointment or anger
and directs attention either to the envied person or the envy object. Inferences of benign envy
should be more likely when the person looks with disappointment at the envied other’s
advantage. Inferences of malicious envy should be more likely when the person looks with
anger at the envied other. We tested these hypotheses in three studies.</p>
      <p>We report all studies we ever conducted in this line of research. We report how we
determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in
the study. The anonymized data, analysis scripts, and materials are available on the Open

      <title>Study 1</title>
      <p>
        The goal of Study 1 was to test whether target’s nonverbal displays when
encountering an advantaged person predict observers’ inferences of benign and malicious
envy. Participants rated targets’ envy across multiple trials involving varying combinations of
the targets’ emotional display and head turning. That is, the targets looked with anger or
disappointment at either the successful person or the high-status object. As a comparison, the
targets also sometimes remained neutral. We predicted combined effects of emotion displays
and head turning on inferences of both benign and malicious envy. Participants should be
more likely to infer benign envy when a target looks with disappointment at the envied
person’s advantage as compared to all other conditions. Conversely, they should be more
likely to infer malicious envy when the target looks with anger at the envied person as
compared to all other conditions. As research suggests that disappointment shares a facial
expression with sadness

        , we used displays of
sadness to operationalize disappointment. To clarify this adapted usage, we refer to the
expressions as sadness in the context of the study but will interpret them as expressions of
disappointment in the discussion. We preregistered our hypotheses, design, and analysis plan

      <p>Participants</p>
      <p>Ninety students from different majors at a Dutch university and volunteers
participated in Study 1. Their mean age was 23.89 years (SD = 8.77, range: 18 – 68; 25 male).
The sample provided approximately 90% power to find an effect of dZ = 0.35 for our
predicted contrasts using α = .05 in a two-tailed test.</p>
      <p>Materials and Procedure</p>
      <p>We invited participants to a study investigating inferences of persons’ emotional
states. They were confronted with a context in which an avatar (a person silhouette) called
either Marc or Anna (gender-matched) is proud of an object they possess. Participants were
randomly allocated to one of nine objects, namely a bike, a car, a bachelor thesis grade, a
laptop, a phone, a trophy, a tv, a vacation spot, or a watch. Participants were distributed
equally across conditions. Each object had 10 participants. Because of a coding error,
however, 11 participants were allocated to the vacation spot and nine people to the tv.</p>
      <p>The categories of objects and the specific pictures were chosen from a larger sample
of objects based on a pretest with N = 50 participants from the same subject pool1. In the
pretest, participants rated the objects on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much) with
respect to how attractive they are, how much they are associated with high status in society,
and how easy it would be to imagine possessing them. For Study 1, we picked objects
perceived as attractive (M = 6.02, SD = 0.60, range: 4.92 – 6.74), granting status (M = 5.02,
SD = 0.72, range: 3.70 – 5.90), and at least possible to possess (M = 4.00, SD = 0.82, range:

OSF.
2.86 – 5.28) without gender differences (corrected for multiple testing). This ensures that the
objects could potentially elicit envy in all participants.</p>
      <p>
        In the main study, participants’ task was to imagine that Marc/Anna meets target
persons and shows them the object across multiple, entirely independent situations.
Marc/Anna was displayed on the left side of the screen, the target was in the center, and the
object was on the right side (Figure 1). In each encounter, the target was initially looking
straight with a neutral expression. Participants could start a video in which the target then
displayed a specific emotional reaction. In particular, the target turned with an angry, neutral,
or sad expression towards either Marc/Anna or the object. The sad expression operationalized
disappointment, as the two share a facial display
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18 ref67 ref71 ref72">(Ekman, 1993; for the same approach see
Van Doorn et al., 2012, 2015)</xref>
        . Participants could watch the video as often as they wanted. In
total, there were four male and four female expressers. We took the stimuli from the validated
Amsterdam Dynamic Facial Expression Set
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66 ref68 ref71">(Van der Schalk et al., 2011)</xref>
        . Thus, in total there
were 24 trials in a 3 Emotion (anger vs. neutral vs. sadness) X 2 Turning (towards person vs.
towards object) X 4 Expresser within-subjects design matched for gender.
      </p>
      <p>
        In each trial, participants rated how much pain, benign envy, and malicious envy
they thought the target was experiencing using Dutch translations of scales based on the
Paindriven Dual Envy Theory
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">(Lange et al., 2018)</xref>
        . The scales measured painful inferiority (e.g.,
“The person feels inadequate”) with three items and benign (e.g., “The person feels a deep
longing for X”) as well as malicious envy (e.g., “The person secretly wishes that the
Marc/Anna would lose X”) with four items each. Methodological advice recommends the use
of such rating scales in research on emotion perception because they allow participants to
indicate their confidence that none of the emotions applies to a stimulus or that multiple
emotions apply to a stimulus
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">(e.g., Russell, 1994)</xref>
        . Across the 24 trials, the scales measuring
pain (αs = .61 – .93), benign envy (αs = .74 – .92), and malicious envy (αs = .80 – .96) were
reliable. We collapsed responses to each scale across expressers.

        <p>Preregistered Analyses</p>
        <p>We initially tested for effects across all dependent variables. Specifically, we
conducted a MANOVA with Emotion (anger vs. neutral vs. sadness) and Turning (towards
person vs. towards object) as within-subject factors and Object (nine different) as
betweensubject factor. Benign envy, malicious envy, and pain served as dependent variables. All
effects of Object and all effects on pain were exploratory. The analysis resulted in
multivariate effects for Emotion, Λ = .05, F(6, 320) = 196.33, p &lt; .001, Turning, Λ = .60, F(3,
79) = 17.65, p &lt; .001, and Emotion X Turning, Λ = .90, F(6, 320) = 2.90, p = .01. The
multivariate effects of Object, Λ = .72, F(24, 229.73) = 1.14, p = .31, Object X Emotion, Λ =
.77, F(48, 476.67) = 0.90, p = .67, Object X Turning, Λ = .76, F(24, 229.73) = 0.96, p = .52,
and the three-way interaction, Λ = .70, F(48, 476.67) = 1.26, p = .12, were not significant.</p>
        <p>To test our specific hypotheses, we conducted univariate ANOVAs separately for
benign and malicious envy. As Object did not have any effect, we excluded it from the
analyses. The results are displayed in Figure 2. For benign envy, there were main effects of
Emotion, F(2, 178) = 60.05, p &lt; .001, ηG2 = .20 and Turning, F(1, 89) = 17.75, p &lt; .001, ηG2 =
.01, but, unexpectedly, no overall interaction, F(2, 178) = 2.10, p = .13, ηG2 = .001. Our
predicted contrast, comparing the condition in which the target turned with a sad expression
towards the object (weight = 5) with all other conditions (weights = -1), was nevertheless
significant, t(89) = 8.44, p &lt; .001, dZ = 0.89. More specifically, the condition in which the
target turned with a sad expression towards the object (M = 4.45, SD = 1.12) led to higher
ratings than the conditions in which the target turned towards the person with an angry (M =
4.07, SD = 1.23), t(89) = 3.19, p = .002, dZ = 0.34, neutral (M = 3.00, SD = 1.12), t(89) =
10.92, p &lt; .001, dZ = 1.15, or sad expression (M = 4.23, SD = 1.16), t(89) = 3.09, p = .003, dZ
= 0.33, or in which the target turned towards the object with a neutral expression (M = 3.06,
SD = 1.12), t(89) = 10.04, p &lt; .001, dZ = 1.06. However, contrary to predictions, it led to
similar ratings as the condition in which the target turned with an angry expression towards
the object (M = 4.32, SD = 1.23), t(89) = 1.01, p = .31, dZ = 0.11.</p>
        <p>For malicious envy, there were main effects of Emotion, F(2, 178) = 358.83, p &lt;
.001, ηG2 = .59 and Turning, F(1, 89) = 46.92, p &lt; .001, ηG2 = .01, as well as an interaction,
F(2, 178) = 6.91, p = .001, ηG2 = .003. Our predicted contrast, comparing the condition in
which the target turned with an angry expression towards the person (weight = 5) to all other
conditions (weights = -1), was significant, t(89) = 26.52, p &lt; .001, dZ = 2.80. More
specifically, the condition in which the target turned with an angry expression towards the
person (M = 5.62, SD = 0.98) led to higher ratings than the conditions in which the target
turned towards the person with a neutral (M = 2.52, SD = 1.17), t(89) = 23.36, p &lt; .001, dZ =
2.46, or sad expression (M = 2.79, SD = 1.09), t(89) = 22.10, p &lt; .001, dZ = 2.33, or in which
the target turned towards the object with an angry (M = 5.20, SD = 1.23), t(89) = 5.25, p &lt;
.001, dZ = 0.55, neutral (M = 2.41, SD = 1.17), t(89) = 23.90, p &lt; .001, dZ = 2.52, or sad
expression (M = 2.52, SD = 1.04), t(89) = 24.95, p &lt; .001, dZ = 2.63.</p>
        <p>Exploratory Analyses</p>
        <p>We conducted additional analyses to test the robustness of the findings and further
explore the results pattern. First, we ran the same univariate ANOVA with pain as the
dependent variable to investigate how observers inferred general negative feelings from the
cues. The analysis resulted in a main effect of Emotion, F(2, 178) = 240.99, p &lt; .001, ηG2 =
.51. The main effect of Turning, F(1, 89) = 0.83, p = .36, ηG2 &lt; .001, and the interaction of
Emotion X Turning, F(2, 178) = 0.04, p = .96, ηG2 &lt; .001, were not significant. Specifically,
pain was higher when the target turned with an angry expression towards the person (M =
3.81, SD = 1.11) or the object (M = 3.78, SD = 1.06) as well as with a sad expression towards
the person (M = 5.35, SD = 0.98) or the object (M = 5.31, SD = 1.01) as compared to when the
target turned with a neutral expression towards the person (M = 2.73, SD = 1.12) or the object
(M = 2.71, SD = 1.05).</p>
        <p>
          Second, we tested for stimulus effects, that is, the effect of different expressers, in
order to rule out that the findings were driven by particular stimuli
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">(Judd et al., 2017)</xref>
          . As
participants judged the standardized emotional displays of expressers and not the expressers
themselves, we reasoned that judgments would not vary much across them. We tested the
robustness of our results with linear mixed models. In separate analyses, benign envy,
malicious envy, and pain served as dependent variables and we treated both participant and
Expresser as random. The analyses had the same fixed effects as the preregistered analyses.
The effects of Emotion, Turning, and Emotion X Turning had the same level of significance
as in the univariate ANOVAs and the variance of the pattern of results between different
expressors was minor. Details of these analyses are available in the supplementary materials.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, we sought to tap into the differences of the envy scales more directly. Even
though our predicted contrasts were significant, the pattern of results did not fit entirely to our
predictions. That is, inferences of benign envy were not particularly high when the target
turned with a sad expression toward the envy object as compared to all other conditions, but
were also rather high when the target turned with anger towards the object and, to a lesser
degree, when the target turned with sadness or anger toward the person. Moreover, inferences
of malicious envy were not particularly high when the target turned with an angry expression
toward the envied person as compared to all other conditions, but were also high when the
target turned with anger toward the object.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-9-2">
        <title>To explore the differences of benign and malicious envy, we repeated the main</title>
        <p>analyses including the type of scale (benign vs. malicious) as another within-subjects factor.
That is, we ran a univariate ANOVA with Emotion (anger vs. neutral vs sadness), Turning
(towards person vs. towards object), and Scale (benign envy vs. malicious envy) as
withinsubjects factors and the intensity rating of the scales as the dependent variable. Scale had a
main effect, F(1, 89) = 27.82, p &lt; .001, ηG2 = .02, reflecting higher values for benign than
malicious envy. More importantly, there was a Scale X Emotion interaction, F(2, 178) =
193.87, p &lt; .001, ηG2 = .22. Specifically, neutral expressions elicited lower scores than anger
and sadness combined for both benign, ΔM = -1.24, SE = 0.13, t(89) = -9.40, p &lt; .001, dZ =
0.99, and malicious envy, ΔM = -1.57, SE = 0.11, t(89) = -14.89, p &lt; .001, dZ = -1.57.
Furthermore, there was no difference between anger and sadness for benign envy, ΔM =
0.14, SE = 0.11, t(89) = -1.33, p = .19, dZ = -0.14, but anger led to higher ratings than sadness
for malicious envy, ΔM = 2.75, SE = 0.12, t(89) = 22.15, p &lt; .001, dZ = 2.33. Moreover, as
expected based on the main analysis, there was a Scale X Turning interaction, F(1, 89) =
50.95, p &lt; .001, ηG2 = .01. Benign envy was higher when the target turned towards the object
than towards the person, ΔM = -0.18, SE = 0.04, t(89) = -4.21, p &lt; .001, dZ = -0.44, whereas
this pattern reversed for malicious envy, ΔM = 0.27, SE = 0.04, t(89) = 6.85, p &lt; .001, dZ =
0.72. Finally, there was also a three-way interaction, F(2, 178) = 7.97, p &lt; .001, ηG2 = .002,
indicating that the results pattern differed in strength between the envy scales. In sum,
participants’ inferences of envy based on emotional displays and head turning were
independent from each other. Participants inferred more benign envy when the target was
emotional and when the target turned toward the object, whereas participants inferred more
malicious envy when the target was angry and when the target turned toward the person.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Study 1 was only partly in line with our hypotheses. As predicted, inferences of
benign envy were highest when the target turned with a sad (i.e., disappointed) expression
towards the object. However, inferences of benign envy were high for both angry and sad
(i.e., disappointed) as compared to neutral expressions. Turning towards the object rather than
the person had a small additional main effect. The combination of both cues did not lead to
particularly high inferences of benign envy. Moreover, as predicted, inferences of malicious
envy were highest when the target turned with an angry expression towards the person.
However, inferences of malicious envy were also rather high when the target turned with an
angry expression towards the object. Even though the interaction of Emotion and Turning was
significant for inferences of malicious envy, it was driven mostly by a smaller effect of
Turning in the neutral condition. Our expectation was, instead, that the interaction would
result from a higher effect of Turning in the anger condition. Thus, also for malicious envy,
the results support main effects of Emotion and Turning more than our predicted contrasts.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, inferences of pain were higher for both angry and sad (i.e.,
disappointed) as compared to neutral expressions independent of Turning. The same contrasts
were significant for benign and malicious envy. In all these tests, effect sizes were large. This
finding indicates that participants were more likely to infer envy when the target reacted
emotionally to another person’s advantage, but not when the target remained neutral.</p>
      <p>Collectively, these results imply that the nonverbal expressions of the target
independently contributed to observer’s inferences of both benign and malicious envy.
Inferences of envy were substantially higher when a target reacted emotionally to an
advantaged other than with a neutral expression. Inferences of benign envy were independent
of whether the target was angry or disappointed but were higher when the target turned
toward the object. Inferences of malicious envy were higher when the target was angry rather
than disappointed, and when the target turned toward the envied person rather than the object.
As Study 1 supported these patterns at least partly based on exploratory analyses, we deemed
it important to replicate them.</p>

      <title>Study 2</title>
      <p>The goal of Study 2 was to replicate the patterns we found in Study 1. We aimed at
corroborating that the main effects of Emotion and Turning varied across the envy forms as
measured with different scales. Specifically, we predicted an interaction of Scale X Emotion.
Inferences of benign envy should be higher when the target displays anger or sadness (i.e.,
disappointment) as compared to remaining neutral. For inferences of malicious envy, the
same contrast should be significant, and inferences of malicious envy should also be higher
when the target displays anger as compared to sadness (i.e., disappointment). We further
predicted an interaction of Scale X Turning. Inferences of benign envy should be higher when
the target turns towards the object as compared to the person, whereas for malicious envy this
effect should be reversed. We preregistered our hypotheses, design, and analysis plan on

We excluded two additional participants because they mentioned after finishing the study that
they did not understand that the target, the person, and the object were supposed to be in the

these participants’ responses would work against proper tests of our hypotheses. The sample

that should measure benign and malicious envy. The items were originally in Dutch. They
translate to “The person feels benign envy towards Marc/Anna” and “The person feels
malicious envy”, respectively.</p>
          <p>
            These new single items could address another concern of Study 1. Most benign envy
items we used in Study 1 referred to the envy object, whereas most malicious envy items
referred to the envied person. This difference in focus reflects the different motivational
orientations of benign and malicious envy
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36 ref64 ref65 ref73">(Lange et al., 2018; Van de Ven, 2016; Van de Ven
et al., 2009)</xref>
            . Yet, in the current case it could additionally lead participants to map the target’s
head turning onto the respective items. Finding evidence for an effect of Turning in benign
and malicious envy independent of this potential confound would provide stronger evidence
for our hypotheses. The new single items not only excluded this confound, they even partly
worked against our hypotheses. That is, the benign envy item mentioned the envied person,
because this was grammatically required in Dutch, while we predicted that for this item,
participants should infer envy when the target turns toward the envy object.
          </p>
          <p>For 10 participants each, the envy object was the car or the watch. For 12
participants, it was the bike. For all other objects, there were 11 participants. Across the 24

        <title>We again analyzed the data in R using packages listed in Study 1.</title>
        <p>Preregistered Analyses</p>
        <p>We first tested our specific hypotheses for different effects of Emotion and Turning
on inferences of benign and malicious envy. We tested the hypotheses for both the scales and
the single items to compare the results. Specifically, we conducted two repeated-measures
ANOVAs, one for the benign and malicious envy scales and one for the two single items.
Beyond this, the analyses were identical. Emotion (anger vs. neutral vs. sadness), Turning
varied in the kind of experimental design (i.e., within and between), the kind of stimuli used
(i.e., assembled stimuli and actual scenes), and the sample (i.e., Dutch and US American),
collectively speaking to the generality of the findings. Thus, a minimal set of expressive
displays combined with contextual information fosters inferences of envy in observers.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the pattern of findings is not fully in line with our original hypotheses.
We predicted that inferences of benign and malicious envy particularly result from the
combined effect of the target’s emotional display and attention allocation. However, the three
studies indicate that the emotional display and attention allocation have independent main
effects. Observers may not need to interactively combine both cues to infer the targets
motivational orientation as either benign or malicious.</p>
        <p>
          Indeed, both emotional displays
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">(e.g., Hareli &amp; Hess, 2010)</xref>
          and attention allocation
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">(e.g., Frischen et al., 2007)</xref>
          may independently tell observers something about the targets
motivational orientation. For instance, if observers infer from a display of disappointment that
a target failed to reach a desired outcome
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">(Van Dijk et al., 1999)</xref>
          , then observing such a
display when a target encounters an advantaged other may suffice to foster inferences of
benign envy. Moreover, turning toward the advantage may imply to the observer that the
target will focus any future motivation on getting the advantage, again fostering inferences of
benign envy independent of the emotional display. For malicious envy, observers may infer
from a display of anger that the target blames the other person
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Ellsworth &amp; Scherer, 2003)</xref>
          which already implicitly implies a focus on the other person independent of attention
allocation. And turning toward the person may imply to the observer the target will direct
future motivation at the envied person. To corroborate the conclusion that different nonverbal
expressions have independent effects on inferences of benign and malicious envy, future
research should conduct studies with other stimuli.
        </p>

          Together with previous findings, the current results suggest that the social perception
of envy is possible, despite previous theoretical statements to the contrary

          . Observers can accurately perceive envy when they
can integrate information about a target’s experience, for instance when they judge an
acquainted person’s inclination to react with envy across situations
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">(Lange et al., 2020)</xref>
          . The
current results add to this previous research by shedding light on what cues observers may use
to infer envy. Future research should investigate the entire process of the social perception of
envy. Specifically, do inferior persons express emotions as well as direct their attention
differently when experiencing benign or malicious envy and do observers then use these cues
to infer envy? Investigating these questions may require having dyads of participants interact
over multiple envy-eliciting situations and measuring expressed cues as well as envy
inferences
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(for an approach see Back et al., 2011)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Potentially, such research could also incorporate other cues than the ones we
investigated. For instance, the verbal content of what persons say or the tone in which they
say it may also allow inferring their envy
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52 ref59">(Rodriguez Mosquera et al., 2010; Silver &amp; Sabini,
1978)</xref>
          . In addition, contextual information about how highly ranked persons display their
success (e.g., by showing off) may also add relevant information observers could use
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref32 ref5">(for a
starting point see Brooks et al., 2019; Lange &amp; Crusius, 2015)</xref>
          . Relatedly, future research
could present these cues successively as compared to simultaneously. In many real-world
cases, cues to a person’s envy may not all be available in the same situation. Instead,
observers probably often need to accumulate information across situations. For instance,
observers may initially see an anger display when a person receives a bad grade in an exam
and may only learn in a subsequent conversation that the anger was directed at a successful
person who showed off repeatedly. Hence, initially observers likely infer that the person is
angry, whereas additional, contextual information may foster inferences of malicious envy.
        </p>
        <p>
          More generally, our results contribute to research on the contextualized nature of
emotion inferences. Initial research tested the recognition of emotions primarily with
idealized pictures of targets’ faces alone
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Elfenbein &amp; Ambady, 2002)</xref>
          . More recent research
emphasizes that contextual cues may change which emotion an observer infers from facial
expressions
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref27 ref6 ref71 ref8">(e.g., Aviezer et al., 2012; Barrett &amp; Kensinger, 2010; Carroll &amp; Russell, 1996;
Kayyal et al., 2015)</xref>
          . In line with this research, our results indicate that observers may infer a
complex emotion such as envy from facial displays of more basic emotions such as anger or
disappointment together with contextual information. Moreover, we extend this research by
taking into account additional dynamic information about the target’s attention allocation in
addition to facial expressions. Future research should investigate whether such multiple,
contextual cues may also foster inferences of other complex emotions such as gratitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          If future research indeed corroborates that emotion inferences rely on the integration
of multiple, contextual cues, this evidence should also inform practical applications.
Currently, industry develops more and more technology dedicated to recognizing emotions
from isolated cues. Specific software and wearables specialize in recognizing emotions from
facial expressions, vocal indicators, or physiological changes, yet technology hardly
integrates multiple cues simultaneously
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(Egger et al., 2019)</xref>
          . As far as we know, context
information is never considered. The current findings suggest that developing technology that
integrates information from multiple, contextual cues will be superior to unimodal or
uncontextualized implementations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the robust support for independent effects of nonverbal expressions on
inferences of envy, our studies also have limitations that future research could address. First,
we did not investigate depictions of actual enviers. We followed the common tradition to
investigate when observers will infer a particular emotion from an idealized expression
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(e.g.,
Elfenbein &amp; Ambady, 2002)</xref>
          . We varied certain nonverbal expressions that previous research
suggested could be present in benign and malicious envy. In reality, people hardly express
emotions fully in an idealized fashion
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49 ref5 ref58">(e.g., Atias et al., 2019; Reisenzein et al., 2006; Shuster
et al., 2020)</xref>
          , which at least somewhat reduces the consistency with which observers infer a
particular emotion
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">(Sauter &amp; Fischer, 2018)</xref>
          or sometimes even limits observers’ ability to
accurately state whether the person experiences something positive or negative
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(Aviezer et al.,
2012)</xref>
          . Future research could use stimuli showing people in actual envy situations or turn to
actual interaction studies that we outlined for investigating the full process of the social
perception of envy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, we had only Western participants. In other cultures, emotions may
communicate different information and hence imply other inferences. For instance, anger can
manifest in different action tendencies in different cultures
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(Boiger et al., 2018)</xref>
          and may have
different interpersonal effects depending on whether a participant comes from a Western or
Eastern cultural background
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(e.g., Adam et al., 2010)</xref>
          . If nonverbal expressions convey
different information to observers in different cultures, inferences of envy may differ
accordingly. Therefore, future research should investigate the robustness of these findings
across cultures.
        </p>
        <p>Third, even though we controlled for demand effects by using rating scales and by
conducting additional analyses with selected items, other demand effects may still partly
underly the effects. Future research should therefore further test the robustness of the
findings. For instance, studies should manipulate more emotional displays and different ways
in which targets allocate their attention. Moreover, they should measure inferences of
additional emotions. In addition, they should use other response formats such as free labeling.
These studies will also provide important information about the distinctiveness of inferences
of benign and malicious envy.</p>
        <p>
          Finally, we used the sadness facial display to operationalize disappointment. We
based this decision on previous theorizing and empirical research that implied that both
emotions share a facial display
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18 ref42 ref45 ref67 ref71 ref72">(e.g., Ekman, 1993; Niewiadomski &amp; Pelachaud, 2007; Van
Doorn et al., 2012, 2015)</xref>
          . Yet, equating both displays means that we cannot know whether
any of the effects we found resulted from a display of disappointment or instead from the
sadness display itself. Future research could assess appraisals that distinguish the two
emotions
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref69">(for research on appraisal patterns of disappointment and sadness see Van Dijk &amp;
Zeelenberg, 2002)</xref>
          . This research should investigate whether observers infer these appraisals
from our stimuli and whether these inferred appraisals explain the effect of the emotional
display on envy inferences
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref25 ref54 ref56">(for a similar approach see Hareli &amp; Hess, 2010; Scherer &amp;
Grandjean, 2008)</xref>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>The current findings provide further insight in the social perception of envy.
Observers use multiple cues when inferring the intensity of benign and malicious envy of
targets who encounter advantaged others. Facial displays and bodily changes independently
contribute to these inferences. Together with previous evidence, the studies therefore imply
that inferences of envy hinge on the integration of multiple expressive and contextual cues.
