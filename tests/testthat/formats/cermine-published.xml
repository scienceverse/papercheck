        <p>Envy shapes social hierarchies. To protect their rank, envied persons react to the threat posed by enviers. Doing so requires that envied persons initially perceive who envies them. However, a common perspective is that envy lacks a unique expression and that enviers disguise their experience, preventing the social perception of envy. In contrast to this perspective, recent evidence indicates that observers perceive benign and malicious forms of envy accurately when they can integrate information about targets. These findings suggest that observers infer envy based on multiple, contextual cues. We hypothesized that observers infer envy from facial and bodily expressions in comparison situations. Specifically, observers should infer benign envy when a target, who encounters an advantaged person, turns with disappointment toward the advantage. Conversely, observers should infer malicious envy when the target turns with anger toward the advantaged person. Three preregistered studies tested these hypotheses (total N = 693). In Studies 1 and 2, targets turned with an emotional or neutral expression either toward a person silhouette or a valuable object, and participants rated targets' envy. In Study 3, participants performed the same task with more realistic stimuli. Across studies, emotional display and head turning had independent effects on inferences of benign and malicious envy. Furthermore, observers inferred envy more when the target expressed an emotion instead of remaining neutral. We discuss how the results inform research on the social perception of envy.</p>

a notable achievement, others may react with envy. Being envied is an
ambivalent experience
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">(Parrott, 2017)</xref>
        . It implies that the person
attained a publicly recognized position, yet enviers also pose a threat
this position. That is, enviers may try to surpass the person in the future
or harm the person’s position immediately. To soothe the situation or
to protect one’s prominent position requires that envied persons can
tell who envies them. Put differently, reacting to others’ envy, first and
foremost, requires accurate inferences of envy.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, previous research mostly reached the conclusion
that it should be impossible for observers to infer another
person’s envy. A common perspective is that enviers typically
disguise their experience toward others (Miceli &amp; Castelfranchi,
2007). In fact, enviers may disguise their experience to such an
extent that they even deny their feelings toward themselves
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">(Smith &amp; Kim, 2007)</xref>
        . In contrast to these perspectives, people
report that they recognize envy in others
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">(Rodriguez Mosquera
et al., 2010)</xref>
        , and recent evidence indicates that acquainted
persons can accurately perceive each other’s dispositional tendency
to experience envy (Lange et al., 2020). Thus, people do seem
to believe they know when others are envious, and their
intuitions may be accurate. These findings beg the question as to
which cues lead people to infer that others are envious? Our
goal was to investigate nonverbal cues that foster envy
inferences in observers.

      <title>The Social Perception of Envy</title>
      <p>
        Envy results from a painful upward comparison and serves the
goal to overcome the difference between the envier and the envied
person
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">(Lange et al., 2018; Parrott &amp; Smith, 1993)</xref>
        . Enviers often
pursue this goal via hostile means such as undermining envied
persons
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(Duffy et al., 2012)</xref>
        or using disparaging labels when talking
about successful others
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">(Rentzsch et al., 2015)</xref>
        . Therefore, scholars
and the media alike preferably portray envy as socially undesirable.
In line with this notion, a common perspective is that envy is an
emotion that people typically disguise toward others and deny toward
themselves
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">(Miceli &amp; Castelfranchi, 2007; Smith &amp; Kim, 2007)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        If enviers conceal their experience, accurately perceiving envy
in others should be challenging. In general, many emotions
involve facial, bodily, verbal, or vocal expressions that, in turn,
play a pivotal role in communicating a person’s experience
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19 ref34 ref57 ref6">(Aviezer et al., 2012; Elfenbein &amp; Ambady, 2002; Sauter et al.,
2010; Witkower &amp; Tracy, 2019)</xref>
        . That is, people express emotions
in different ways and observers decode these expressions to infer
associated emotional experiences. For envy, however, research has
not yet proposed unique expressions. Given envy’s socially
undesirable character and disguised nature, enviers may simply not
reveal many signs of their experience to observers.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is, however, reason to predict that enviers cannot conceal
their envy entirely. As a starting point, research indicates that envy
contributes to the regulation of social hierarchies
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(Crusius &amp;
Lange, 2017; Fiske, 2010)</xref>
        . The desire for social rank is a
fundamental human motive
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Anderson et al., 2015)</xref>
        , and envy serves to
level rank differences between the self and higher-ranked others
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45 ref46 ref53">(Lange &amp; Crusius, 2015; see also Van de Ven, 2016; Van de Ven
et al., 2009)</xref>
        . An experience sampling study suggests that, to serve
this fundamental need, enviers’ cognitions and motivations
following an envy-eliciting event guide their behavior over multiple days
(Lange et al., 2018). Considering the importance of engaging in
action to overcome painful rank differentials and the temporally
extended character of envy, it is likely that enviers leak cues to
their experience at some point in time. Furthermore, the
importance of protecting social rank predicts that higher-ranked persons
will be vigilant to perceive cues to other’s envy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Anderson et al.,
2015)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>Indeed, in line with this reasoning, research indicates that
accurate social perception of envy is possible (Lange et al., 2020).
People’s self-ratings of their dispositional inclination to react with
envy correlated positively with acquainted peers’ perception of
people’s dispositional inclination. Further analyses implied that
this correlation could not be explained by people and peers just
being similar to each other and projecting their own personality
onto each other. However, self-ratings of envy in a particular
situation were uncorrelated with unacquainted dyad partners’
perception of people’s experience.</p>
      <p>
        These findings imply that others may need to integrate multiple
pieces of information to derive accurate insight in another person’s
envy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">(see also Puranik et al., 2019)</xref>
        . Each cue to a person’s envy
considered in isolation is likely ambiguous, as is the case for most
emotions that are considered nonprototypical (Fehr &amp; Russell,
1984). For instance, the painful inferiority people experience
probably manifests in an expression, yet there is no distinct expression
associated with envy. Moreover, envy may manifest in behaviors
such as criticizing, congratulating, or gossiping, yet none of these
behaviors is uniquely associated with envy. Inferring from such
cues that a person is envious necessarily requires taking contextual
information into account (e.g., that the person criticizes someone
who is better-off). The need to integrate information—to integrate
multiple, contextual cues, which each considered separately are
ambiguous—distinguishes envy from many other, primarily
prototypical emotions. For instance, emotions such as anger, sadness, or
pride but also boredom, embarrassment, or shame have unique
facial expressions that already in isolation enable their recognition
by observers (Keltner et al., 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, people may not decode envy from a single cue such as a
distinct facial expression but rather from a combination of
expressive displays and contextual information. When enviers express
several cues in the same situation or when people can observe
these cues across several situations, observers may integrate them
and be able to put them together in a coherent picture. Supporting
this idea, in one of the few studies on the social perception of
envy, people judged others to be envious based on multiple,
contextual cues, namely when targets uttered rude comments about a
befriended, advantaged person toward an uninvolved third party
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">(Silver &amp; Sabini, 1978)</xref>
        . In line with the expectation that inferring
others’ envy requires the integration of multiple, contextual cues,
evidence implies that envy can occur in different forms that are
partly constituted by different feelings, cognitions, and
motivations as well as manifest in different behaviors. This evidence is
where we turn next.

      <title>Inferring Envy</title>
      <p>
        The experience of envy involves changes in several feelings,
cognitions, motivations, and expressive behaviors
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12 ref25 ref9">(e.g., Lange et
al., 2018; Parrott &amp; Smith, 1993)</xref>
        . Moreover, theories on envy
argue that envy entails different emotions
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">(Smith, 2004)</xref>
        . In fact,
complex emotions such as envy can involve or be accompanied by
basic emotions, particularly if the complex and basic emotions
result from similar appraisals
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23 ref26">(for related arguments see for
instance Oatley &amp; Johnson-Laird, 1987; Plutchik, 1982)</xref>
        .
Therefore, the painful experience inherent in envy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">(Lange et al., 2018;
Tai et al., 2012)</xref>
        may lead to changes in the face or body, conveyed
via the expression of more basic emotions. Accounting for envy’s
complexity, methodologically diverse research disentangled two
qualitatively different manifestations—benign and malicious envy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref21 ref46 ref53">(Falcon, 2015; Lange et al., 2018; Van de Ven et al., 2009; for a
comparison of different perspectives on envy see Crusius et al.,
2020)</xref>
        . As both forms of envy result from different appraisals
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48 ref51">(Lange et al., 2016; Van de Ven et al., 2012)</xref>
        , they are likely to
share similarities with different more basic emotions, the
expression of which may therefore provide cues observers could use to
infer different forms of envy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Benign envy is constituted by feelings, cognitions, and
motivations directed at improving the envier’s position
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46 ref53">(Lange et al.,
2018; Van de Ven et al., 2009)</xref>
        . It manifests in improvement
behaviors such as increased effort in achievement tasks
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44 ref47 ref51">(Lange &amp;
Crusius, 2015; Van de Ven et al., 2011)</xref>
        or risk-taking (Kwon et
al., 2017). Moreover, when experiencing benign envy, people
direct attention equally to the envied person as well as the envied
person’s advantage and focus on means to improve their situation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Crusius &amp; Lange, 2014)</xref>
        . Benign envy results from enviers’
evaluation that they failed to reach a desired outcome (Lange et al.,

2018; Van de Ven et al., 2012). This appraisal also leads to
disappointment
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">(Van Dijk et al., 1999)</xref>
        . Disappointment is part of the
basic sadness emotion family
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">(e.g., Shaver et al., 1987)</xref>
        and,
correspondingly, shares a facial expression with it
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18 ref22 ref25 ref48 ref51">(e.g., Ekman, 1993;
Niewiadomski &amp; Pelachaud, 2007; Van Doorn et al., 2012)</xref>
        .
Hence, in benign envy situations, enviers may express
disappointment and direct attention to the envied person or the object of their
desire, which could serve as cues to their experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Malicious envy is constituted by feelings, cognitions, and
motivations directed at harming the envied person’s position
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46 ref53">(Lange et
al., 2018; Van de Ven et al., 2009)</xref>
        . It manifests in aggressive
behaviors such as withholding money from the envied person
(Moyal et al., 2020) or feeling schadenfreude when the envied
person fails (Lange et al., 2018). Moreover, when experiencing
malicious envy, people direct attention to the envied person at the
expense of the envied person’s advantage
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Crusius &amp; Lange,
2014)</xref>
        . Malicious envy results from enviers’ evaluation that the
successful person’s advantage is undeserved and that they blame
others for the unfavorable rank difference
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46 ref48 ref51 ref53">(Van de Ven et al.,
2009, 2012)</xref>
        . These appraisals also lead to anger
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Ellsworth &amp;
Scherer, 2003)</xref>
        , which has a recognizable facial display
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Elfenbein
&amp; Ambady, 2002)</xref>
        . Hence, in malicious envy, enviers may express
anger and direct attention to the envied person, which could serve
as cues to their experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The foregoing considerations suggest that the different forms of
envy manifest themselves in different cues in the context of an
upward comparison. This is important, because contextual
information shapes which emotions observers infer
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(e.g., Barrett &amp;
Kensinger, 2010; Kayyal et al., 2015)</xref>
        , especially when the
emotion implied by the respective context is a nonbasic emotion
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Carroll &amp; Russell, 1996)</xref>
        . That is, expressions of certain emotions in a
particular context may lead observers to infer a different emotion.
Investigating such cues could therefore illuminate the social
perception of envy. Following this notion, we focus on a minimal set
of theoretically relevant expressive behaviors in a particular
context that people may use as cues to infer envy.

      <title>Cues of Benign and Malicious Envy</title>
      <p>
        Envy always occurs in situations in which a person has an
advantage that is widely regarded as conveying high status. By
definition, envy is a response to another person’s higher quality,
achievement, or possession
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">(Parrott &amp; Smith, 1993)</xref>
        , especially
when this advantage is relevant and valuable in the eyes of others
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(Crusius &amp; Lange, 2017; Fiske, 2010)</xref>
        . Because another person’s
advantage is the basis of envy, benign and malicious envy
similarly result from it
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12 ref9">(e.g., Lange et al., 2018)</xref>
        . When encountering a
disadvantaged person vis-à-vis an advantaged person, observers
may already infer that envy is likely to occur
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">(e.g., Silver &amp;
Sabini, 1978)</xref>
        . Beyond this general contextual information,
observers may base their inferences on enviers’ facial expressions of
disappointment or anger together with the different foci of attention
on the envied person or the envied person’s advantage. Research
indeed suggests that observers can make inferences from such
cues.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, observers can derive information from people’s facial
expressions. Observers have affective reactions to facial
expressions or infer a target’s personal and situational characteristics
from them (Lange et al., 2021; Van Kleef &amp; Côté, in press).
Moreover, observers use facial expressions to infer the underlying
appraisal of the target
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">(Scherer &amp; Grandjean, 2008)</xref>
        and draw
conclusions about the target’s motivation (Hareli &amp; Hess, 2010). In
envy situations, enviers’ disappointment or anger could reveal
information about the envier’s desires to observers. Given that
disappointment is associated with a missed positive outcome
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">(Van
Dijk et al., 1999; here the envied person’s advantage)</xref>
        , observers
may infer that the (benign) envier desires the advantage.
Conversely, given that anger is associated with blaming others
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Ellsworth &amp; Scherer, 2003; here the envied person)</xref>
        for an unfair
situation, observers may infer that the (malicious) envier wants to
harm the envied person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, observers can also derive information from people’s
eye gaze. Where people direct their attention provides information
to observers regarding people’s motivational orientation (Frischen
et al., 2007), also because motivation drives attention allocation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">(Vogt et al., 2010)</xref>
        . The differential foci on the envied person or
the envied person’s advantage may similarly convey information
about enviers’ goals. Benign enviers direct attention equally to the
envied person and the envied person’s advantage
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Crusius &amp;
Lange, 2014)</xref>
        . Yet, attention toward the advantage should signal to
observers that the envier has the goal to improve, leading to
inferences of benign envy more than when the envier simultaneously
focuses on the envied person. Malicious enviers direct attention to
the envied person more than the envied person’s advantage
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Crusius &amp; Lange, 2014)</xref>
        . This attentional focus would therefore
indicate to observers that the person’s motivational orientation is
directed at the envied person.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hypothesize that observers’ inferences of benign and
malicious envy result from the combination of these two nonverbal
cues in the presence of an advantaged person. Indeed, the
recognition of emotional displays improves when the faces’ focus of
attention matches the motivational direction of the emotion
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Adams &amp; Kleck, 2005)</xref>
        . We predict that inferences of benign
envy are more likely when a person looks with disappointment at
the successful person’s advantage. This combined set of cues
signals to observers that the person failed to reach the desired
advantage, implying that the envier is motivated to overcome the rank
differential by improving the self. We further predict that
inferences of malicious envy are more likely when a person looks with
anger at the envied person. This combined set of cues signals to
observers that the person blames others for an undeserved
disadvantage and is motivated to aggress against the envied person.
Thus, we argue that the combination of nonverbal expressions and
contextual information provides cues that lead observers to infer
that a person experiences benign or malicious envy.

      <title>The Current Research</title>
      <p>In most previous theorizing it has been argued that it is
impossible for observers to infer that another person is envious. In
contrast, in line with research on the contextualized nature of emotion
perception, we argue that observers can infer benign and malicious
envy from multiple, contextual cues. Specifically, we predict that
people infer benign or malicious envy from a combination of
expressive displays and contextual information, namely when a
person encounters an advantaged other person and expresses either
disappointment or anger and directs attention either to the envied
person or the envy object. Inferences of benign envy should be

      <title>Study 1</title>
      <p>
        The goal of Study 1 was to test whether targets’ nonverbal
displays when encountering an advantaged person predict observers’
inferences of benign and malicious envy. Participants rated
targets’ envy across multiple trials involving varying combinations
of the targets’ emotional display and head turning. That is, the
targets looked with anger or disappointment at either the successful
person or the high-status object. As a comparison, the targets also
sometimes remained neutral. We predicted combined effects of
emotion displays and head turning on inferences of both benign
and malicious envy. Participants should be more likely to infer
benign envy when a target looks with disappointment at the envied
person’s advantage as compared with all other conditions.
Conversely, they should be more likely to infer malicious envy when
the target looks with anger at the envied person as compared with
all other conditions. As research suggests that disappointment
shares a facial expression with sadness

Doorn et al., 2012)</xref>
        , we used displays of sadness to operationalize
disappointment. To clarify this adapted usage, we refer to the
expressions as sadness in the context of the study but will interpret
them as expressions of disappointment in the discussion. We
preregistered our hypotheses, design, and analysis plan on

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p>Ninety students from different majors at a Dutch university and
volunteers participated in Study 1. Their mean age was 23.89
years (SD = 8.77, range: 18–68; 25 male). The sample provided
approximately 90% power to find an effect of dZ = 0.35 for our
predicted contrasts using a = .05 in a two-tailed test.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-7-2">
        <title>Materials and Procedure</title>
        <p>We invited participants to a study investigating inferences of
persons’ emotional states. They were confronted with a context in
which an avatar (a person silhouette) called either Marc or Anna
(gender-matched) is proud of an object they possess. Participants
were randomly allocated to one of nine objects, namely a bike, a
car, a bachelor thesis grade, a laptop, a phone, a trophy, a tv, a
vacation spot, or a watch. Participants were distributed equally
across conditions. Each object had 10 participants. Because of a
coding error, however, 11 participants were allocated to the
vacation spot and nine people to the tv.</p>
        <p>The categories of objects and the specific pictures were chosen
from a larger sample of objects based on a pretest with N = 50
participants from the same subject pool.1 In the pretest, participants
rated the objects on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much)
with respect to how attractive they are, how much they are
associated with high status in society, and how easy it would be to
imagine possessing them. For Study 1, we picked objects perceived as
attractive (M = 6.02, SD = 0.60, range: 4.92–6.74), granting status
(M = 5.02, SD = 0.72, range: 3.70–5.90), and at least possible to
possess (M = 4.00, SD = 0.82, range: 2.86–5.28) without gender
differences (corrected for multiple testing). This ensures that the
objects could potentially elicit envy in all participants.</p>
        <p>
          In the main study, participants’ task was to imagine that Marc/
Anna meets target persons and shows them the object across
multiple, entirely independent situations. Marc/Anna was displayed on
the left side of the screen, the target was in the center, and the
object was on the right side (see Figure 1). In each encounter, the
target was initially looking straight with a neutral expression.
Participants could start a video in which the target then displayed a
specific emotional reaction. In particular, the target turned with an
angry, neutral, or sad expression toward either Marc/Anna or the
object. The sad expression operationalized disappointment, as the
two share a facial display
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18 ref48 ref51 ref52">(Ekman, 1993; for the same approach,
see Van Doorn et al., 2012, 2015)</xref>
          . Participants could watch the
video as often as they wanted. In total, there were four male and
four female expressers. We took the stimuli from the validated
Amsterdam Dynamic Facial Expression Set
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44 ref47 ref51">(Van der Schalk et al.,
2011)</xref>
          . Thus, in total there were 24 trials in a 3 Emotion (anger vs.
neutral vs. sadness) 3 2 Turning (toward person vs. toward object) 3
4 Expresser within-subjects design matched for gender.
        </p>
        <p>
          In each trial, participants rated how much pain, benign envy,
and malicious envy they thought the target was experiencing using
Dutch translations of scales based on the Pain-driven Dual Envy
Theory (Lange et al., 2018). The scales measured painful
inferiority (e.g., “The person feels inadequate”) with three items and
benign (e.g., “The person feels a deep longing for X”) as well as
malicious envy (e.g., “The person secretly wishes that the Marc/
Anna would lose X”) with four items each. Methodological advice
recommends the use of such rating scales in research on emotion
perception because they allow participants to indicate their
confidence that none of the emotions applies to a stimulus or that
multiple emotions apply to a stimulus
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">(e.g., Russell, 1994)</xref>
          . Across the
24 trials, the scales measuring pain (as = .61–.93), benign envy
(as = .74–.92), and malicious envy (as = .80–.96) were reliable.
We collapsed responses to each scale across expressers.

        <title>Preregistered Analyses</title>
        <p>We initially tested for effects across all dependent variables.
Specifically, we conducted a MANOVA with Emotion (anger vs. neutral
vs. sadness) and Turning (toward person vs. toward object) as
within-subject factors and Object (nine different) as between-subjects
factor. Benign envy, malicious envy, and pain served as dependent
variables. All effects of Object and all effects on pain were
exploratory. The analysis resulted in multivariate effects for Emotion, K =
.05, F(6, 320) = 196.33, p , .001, Turning, K = .60, F(3, 79) =
17.65, p , .001, and Emotion 3 Turning, K = .90, F(6, 320) = 2.90,
p = .01. The multivariate effects of Object, K = .72, F(24, 229.73) =
1.14, p = .31, Object 3 Emotion, K = .77, F(48, 476.67) = 0.90,
p = .67, Object 3 Turning, K = .76, F(24, 229.73) = 0.96, p = .52,
and the three-way interaction, K = .70, F(48, 476.67) = 1.26, p = .12,
were not significant.</p>
        <p>To test our specific hypotheses, we conducted univariate
ANOVAs separately for benign and malicious envy. Because
Object did not have any effect, we excluded it from the analyses.
The results are displayed in Figure 2. For benign envy, there were
main effects of Emotion, F(2, 178) = 60.05, p , .001, hG2 = .20
and Turning, F(1, 89) = 17.75, p , .001, hG2 = .01, but,
unexpectedly, no overall interaction, F(2, 178) = 2.10, p = .13, hG2 = .001.
Our predicted contrast, comparing the condition in which the
target turned with a sad expression toward the object (weight = 5)
with all other conditions (weights = 1), was nevertheless
significant, t(89) = 8.44, p , .001, dZ = 0.89. More specifically, the
condition in which the target turned with a sad expression toward the
object (M = 4.45, SD = 1.12) led to higher ratings than the
conditions in which the target turned toward the person with an angry
(M = 4.07, SD = 1.23), t(89) = 3.19, p = .002, dZ = 0.34, neutral
(M = 3.00, SD = 1.12), t(89) = 10.92, p , .001, dZ = 1.15, or sad
expression (M = 4.23, SD = 1.16), t(89) = 3.09, p = .003, dZ =
0.33, or in which the target turned toward the object with a neutral
expression (M = 3.06, SD = 1.12), t(89) = 10.04, p , .001, dZ =
1.06. However, contrary to predictions, it led to similar ratings as the
condition in which the target turned with an angry expression toward
the object (M = 4.32, SD = 1.23), t(89) = 1.01, p = .31, dZ = 0.11.</p>
        <p>For malicious envy, there were main effects of Emotion, F(2,
178) = 358.83, p , .001, hG2 = .59 and Turning, F(1, 89) = 46.92,
p , .001, hG2 = .01, as well as an interaction, F(2, 178) = 6.91, p =
.001, hG2 = .003. Our predicted contrast, comparing the condition
in which the target turned with an angry expression toward the
person (weight = 5) to all other conditions (weights = 1), was
significant, t(89) = 26.52, p , .001, dZ = 2.80. More specifically,
the condition in which the target turned with an angry expression
toward the person (M = 5.62, SD = 0.98) led to higher ratings than
the conditions in which the target turned toward the person with a
neutral (M = 2.52, SD = 1.17), t(89) = 23.36, p , .001, dZ = 2.46,
or sad expression (M = 2.79, SD = 1.09), t(89) = 22.10, p , .001,
dZ = 2.33, or in which the target turned toward the object with an
angry (M = 5.20, SD = 1.23), t(89) = 5.25, p , .001, dZ = 0.55,
neutral (M = 2.41, SD = 1.17), t(89) = 23.90, p , .001, dZ = 2.52,
or sad expression (M = 2.52, SD = 1.04), t(89) = 24.95, p , .001,
dZ = 2.63.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-8-2">
        <title>Exploratory Analyses</title>
        <p>We conducted additional analyses to test the robustness of the
findings and further explore the results pattern. First, we ran the
same univariate ANOVA with pain as the dependent variable to
investigate how observers inferred general negative feelings from
the cues. The analysis resulted in a main effect of Emotion, F(2,
178) = 240.99, p , .001, hG2 = .51. The main effect of Turning,
F(1, 89) = 0.83, p = .36, hG2 , .001, and the interaction of Emotion 3
Turning, F(2, 178) = 0.04, p = .96, hG2 , .001, were not significant.
Specifically, pain was higher when the target turned with an angry
expression toward the person (M = 3.81, SD = 1.11) or the object
(M = 3.78, SD = 1.06) as well as with a sad expression toward the
person (M = 5.35, SD = 0.98) or the object (M = 5.31, SD = 1.01) as
compared with when the target turned with a neutral expression
toward the person (M = 2.73, SD = 1.12) or the object (M = 2.71,
SD = 1.05).</p>
        <p>Second, we tested for stimulus effects, that is, the effect of
different expressers, to rule out that the findings were driven by
particular stimuli (Judd et al., 2017). As participants judged the
standardized emotional displays of expressers and not the
expressers themselves, we reasoned that judgments would not vary much
across them. We tested the robustness of our results with linear
mixed models. In separate analyses, benign envy, malicious envy,
and pain served as dependent variables, and we treated both
participant and Expresser as random. The analyses had the same fixed
effects as the preregistered analyses. The effects of Emotion,
Turning, and Emotion 3 Turning had the same level of significance as
in the univariate ANOVAs and the variance of the pattern of
results between different expressors was minor. Details of these
analyses are available in the online supplemental materials.</p>
        <p>Finally, we sought to tap into the differences of the envy scales
more directly. Even though our predicted contrasts were
significant, the pattern of results did not fit entirely to our predictions.
That is, inferences of benign envy were not particularly high when
the target turned with a sad expression toward the envy object as
compared with all other conditions but were also rather high when
the target turned with anger toward the object and, to a lesser
degree, when the target turned with sadness or anger toward the
person. Moreover, inferences of malicious envy were not
particularly high when the target turned with an angry expression toward
the envied person as compared with all other conditions but were
also high when the target turned with anger toward the object.</p>
        <p>To explore the differences of benign and malicious envy, we
repeated the main analyses including the type of scale (benign vs.
malicious) as another within-subjects factor. That is, we ran a
univariate ANOVA with Emotion (anger vs. neutral vs sadness),
Turning (toward person vs. toward object), and Scale (benign
envy vs. malicious envy) as within-subjects factors and the
intensity rating of the scales as the dependent variable. Scale had a
main effect, F(1, 89) = 27.82, p , .001, hG2 = .02, reflecting higher
values for benign than malicious envy. More importantly, there
was a Scale 3 Emotion interaction, F(2, 178) = 193.87, p , .001,
hG2 = .22. Specifically, neutral expressions elicited lower scores
than anger and sadness combined for both benign, DM = 1.24,
SE = 0.13, t(89) = 9.40, p , .001, dZ = 0.99, and malicious
envy, DM = 1.57, SE = 0.11, t(89) = 14.89, p , .001,
dZ = 1.57. Furthermore, there was no difference between anger
and sadness for benign envy, DM = 0.14, SE = 0.11, t(89) =
1.33, p = .19, dZ = 0.14, but anger led to higher ratings than
sadness for malicious envy, DM = 2.75, SE = 0.12, t(89) = 22.15,
p , .001, dZ = 2.33. Moreover, as expected based on the main
analysis, there was a Scale 3 Turning interaction, F(1, 89) =
50.95, p , .001, hG2 = .01. Benign envy was higher when the target
turned toward the object than toward the person, DM = 0.18,
SE = 0.04, t(89) = 4.21, p , .001, dZ = 0.44, whereas this
pattern reversed for malicious envy, DM = 0.27, SE = 0.04, t(89) =
6.85, p , .001, dZ = 0.72. Finally, there was also a three-way
interaction, F(2, 178) = 7.97, p , .001, hG2 = .002, indicating that
the results pattern differed in strength between the envy scales. In
sum, participants’ inferences of envy based on emotional displays
and head turning were independent from each other. Participants
inferred more benign envy when the target was emotional and
when the target turned toward the object, whereas participants
inferred more malicious envy when the target was angry and when
the target turned toward the person.</p>

    <sec id="sec-9">
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Study 1 was only partly in line with our hypotheses. As
predicted, inferences of benign envy were highest when the target
turned with a sad (i.e., disappointed) expression toward the object.
However, inferences of benign envy were high for both angry and
sad (i.e., disappointed) as compared with neutral expressions.
Turning toward the object rather than the person had a small
additional main effect. The combination of both cues did not lead to
particularly high inferences of benign envy. Moreover, as
predicted, inferences of malicious envy were highest when the target
turned with an angry expression toward the person. However,
inferences of malicious envy were also rather high when the target
turned with an angry expression toward the object. Even though
the interaction of Emotion and Turning was significant for
inferences of malicious envy, it was driven mostly by a smaller effect
of Turning in the neutral condition. Our expectation was, instead,
that the interaction would result from a higher effect of Turning in
the anger condition. Thus, also for malicious envy, the results
support main effects of Emotion and Turning more than our predicted
contrasts.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, inferences of pain were higher for both angry and
sad (i.e., disappointed) as compared with neutral expressions
independent of Turning. The same contrasts were significant for
benign and malicious envy. In all these tests, effect sizes were large.
This finding indicates that participants were more likely to infer
envy when the target reacted emotionally to another person’s
advantage, but not when the target remained neutral.</p>
      <p>Collectively, these results imply that the nonverbal expressions
of the target independently contributed to observer’s inferences of
both benign and malicious envy. Inferences of envy were
substantially higher when a target reacted emotionally to an advantaged
other than with a neutral expression. Inferences of benign envy
were independent of whether the target was angry or disappointed
but were higher when the target turned toward the object.
Inferences of malicious envy were higher when the target was angry
rather than disappointed, and when the target turned toward the
envied person rather than the object. Because Study 1 supported
these patterns at least partly based on exploratory analyses, we
deemed it important to replicate them.

      <title>Study 2</title>
      <p>The goal of Study 2 was to replicate the patterns we found in
Study 1. We aimed at corroborating that the main effects of
Emotion and Turning varied across the envy forms as measured
with different scales. Specifically, we predicted an interaction of
Scale 3 Emotion. Inferences of benign envy should be higher
when the target displays anger or sadness (i.e., disappointment)
as compared with remaining neutral. For inferences of malicious
envy, the same contrast should be significant, and inferences of
malicious envy should also be higher when the target displays
anger as compared with sadness (i.e., disappointment). We
further predicted an interaction of Scale 3 Turning. Inferences of
benign envy should be higher when the target turns toward the
object as compared with the person, whereas for malicious envy
this effect should be reversed. We preregistered our hypotheses,
design, and analysis plan on AsPredicted.org (https://aspredicted

        <p>Ninety-eight students from different majors of a Dutch
university and volunteers participated in Study 2. Their mean age was
24.53 years (SD = 10, range: 17–69; 23 male). We excluded two
additional participants because they mentioned after finishing the
study that they did not understand that the target, the person, and
the object were supposed to be in the same situation. Even though
this exclusion criterion was not preregistered, we reasoned that
these participants’ responses would work against proper tests of
our hypotheses. The sample provided approximately 90% power
to find an effect of dZ = 0.33 for our predicted contrasts using a =

      <sec id="sec-11-2">
        <title>Materials and Procedure</title>
        <p>The design was identical to Study 1 except for one change: We
excluded the pain items because they were not central to our
hypothesis tests. Instead, we included two other items that should
measure benign and malicious envy. The items were originally in
Dutch. They translate to “The person feels benign envy toward
Marc/Anna” and “The person feels malicious envy,” respectively.</p>
        <p>
          These new single items could address another concern of Study
1. Most benign envy items we used in Study 1 referred to the envy
object, whereas most malicious envy items referred to the envied

orientations of benign and malicious envy

          . Yet, in the current
case it could additionally lead participants to map the target’s head
turning onto the respective items. Finding evidence for an effect
of Turning in benign and malicious envy independent of this
potential confound would provide stronger evidence for our
hypotheses. The new single items not only excluded this confound,
they even partly worked against our hypotheses. That is, the
benign envy item mentioned the envied person, because this was
grammatically required in Dutch, whereas we predicted that for
this item, participants should infer envy when the target turns
toward the envy object.
        </p>
        <p>For 10 participants each, the envy object was the car or the watch.
For 12 participants, it was the bike. For all other objects, there were
11 participants. Across the 24 trials, the scales measuring benign
(as = .73–.95) and malicious envy (as = .82–.97) were reliable. We
collapsed responses to each scale or single item across expressers.</p>

      <p>We again analyzed the data in R using packages listed in Study 1.</p>
      <sec id="sec-12-1">
        <title>Preregistered Analyses</title>
        <p>We first tested our specific hypotheses for different effects of
Emotion and Turning on inferences of benign and malicious envy.
We tested the hypotheses for both the scales and the single items
to compare the results. Specifically, we conducted two
repeatedmeasures ANOVAs, one for the benign and malicious envy scales
and one for the two single items. Beyond this, the analyses were
identical. Emotion (anger vs. neutral vs. sadness), Turning (toward
person vs. toward object), and Scale (benign envy vs. malicious
envy) served as independent variables. The intensity rating was
the dependent variable.</p>
        <p>The results for the scales are depicted in Figure 3. The
analysis resulted in main effects for Scale, F(1, 97) = 56.97, p ,
.001, hG2 = .04, and Emotion, F(2, 194) = 294.55, p , .001,
hG2 = .40. The effect of Turning was not significant, F(1, 97) =
1.04, p = .31, hG2 , .001, as was the interaction of Emotion 3
Turning, F(2, 194) = 1.14, p = .32, hG2 , .001. More
importantly, there was the predicted Scale 3 Emotion interaction, F
(2, 194) = 259.79, p , .001, hG2 = .25. Replicating Study 1,
neutral expressions as compared with anger and sadness led to
lower ratings of benign, DM = 1.71, SE = 0.13, t(97) =
13.63, p , .001, dZ = 1.38, and malicious envy, DM =
1.79, SE = 0.10, t(97) = 17.71, p , .001, dZ = 1.79.
Moreover, anger led to higher ratings of malicious envy than sadness,
DM = 2.81, SE = 0.11, t(97) = 25.14, p , .001, dZ = 2.54.
Contrary to Study 1 but in line with our initial hypotheses, anger led
to lower ratings of benign envy than sadness, DM = 0.51, SE =
0.10, t(97) = 4.91, p , .001, dZ = 0.50. Moreover, also in
line with our predictions, there was a Scale 3 Turning
interaction, F(1, 97) = 16.21, p , .001, hG2 = .004. Replicating Study 1,
turning toward the person as compared with the object led to
lower ratings of benign envy, DM = 0.18, SE = 0.05, t(97) =
3.37, p = .001, dZ = 0.34, but higher ratings of malicious
envy, DM = 0.13, SE = 0.04, t(97) = 3.21, p = .002, dZ = 0.32.
Finally, the analysis also produced an unexpected three-way
interaction, F(2, 194) = 4.60, p = .01, hG2 = .001, again
indicating that the results pattern differed in strength between the envy
scales.</p>
        <p>The results for the single items are depicted in Figure 4. The
analysis resulted in main effects for Scale, F(1, 97) = 22.44, p ,
.001, hG2 = .02, Emotion, F(2, 194) = 218.31, p , .001, hG2 = .43,
and Turning, F(1, 97) = 7.13, p = .01, hG2 = .002, but no interaction
of Emotion 3 Turning, F(2, 194) = 1.95, p = .14, hG2 , .001, and
no three-way-interaction, F(2, 194) = 0.26, p = .77, hG2 , .001.
Importantly, there was the predicted Scale 3 Emotion interaction,
2 In the preregistration, we erroneously refer to the predicted Scale 3
Turning interaction as Emotion 3 Turning. Note, however, that the specific
contrasts we describe for the interaction are indeed the predicted contrasts.
F(2, 194) = 45.85, p , .001, hG2 = .06. As for the scales, neutral
expressions, compared with anger and sadness, led to lower ratings
of benign, DM = 2.18, SE = 0.14, t(97) = 15.36, p , .001, dZ =
1.55, and malicious envy, DM = 1.94, SE = 0.13, t(97) =
15.40, p , .001, dZ = 1.56. Anger led to higher ratings of
malicious envy than sadness, DM = 2.42, SE = 0.16, t(97) = 15.40, p ,
.001, dZ = 1.56. In direct opposition to the results for the scales,
benign envy ratings were also higher for anger than for sadness,
DM = 0.82, SE = 0.18, t(97) = 4.57, p , .001, dZ = 0.46, even
though the effect was smaller than for malicious envy. Finally,
the predicted Scale 3 Turning interaction was not significant, F(1,
97) = 1.80, p = .18, hG2 , .001. That is, contrary to predictions,
ratings tended to be higher when the target turned toward the person
as compared with the object for both benign, DM = 0.15, SE =
0.05, t(97) = 2.91, p = .01, dZ = 0.29, and malicious envy, DM =
0.08, SE = 0.05, t(97) = 1.54, p = .13, dZ = 0.16.</p>

        <title>Exploratory Analyses</title>
        <p>We again tested the robustness of our findings in different ways.
First, as in Study 1, we explored whether the preregistered
analyses were unchanged when treating Expresser as another random
effect. This was the case. The results are available in the online
supplemental materials.</p>
        <p>Second, we conducted another test to see whether the effect of
Turning on benign and malicious envy depends on the frequency
with which the envy object and the envied person are mentioned
in the benign and malicious envy scales, respectively. The analysis
of the single items supported that the interaction of Scale 3
Turning is absent when the frequency is controlled for. However,
talking to participants after the study and inspecting Figure 4 led
us to doubt whether the single items indeed captured benign and
malicious envy as we had intended. In informal conversations after
the study, participants especially indicated that the benign envy
item may capture malicious envy as well, just not as explicitly.
Therefore, we conducted another test with selected items from the
benign and malicious envy scales that do not confound the
mentioning of the envied person and envy object in favor of our
hypotheses. Specifically, we selected an item from the benign
envy scale that mentioned the envied person. This item even works
against our hypothesis because we predicted that benign envy is
higher when the target turns toward the envy object. Moreover, we
selected an item from the malicious envy scale that measured
nondirected feelings of hatred. This item therefore neither mentions
the envied person nor the envy object and, hence, cannot have
biased participants’ responses in the direction of our hypothesis.
Thus, repeating the analyses with these selected items constitutes a
robustness check of the preregistered analyses, testing whether
support for our hypotheses is driven by a demand effect.</p>
        <p>The results of these selected items are depicted in Figure 5. The
analysis resulted in main effects of Scale, F(1, 97) = 50.06, p ,
.001, hG2 = .06, and Emotion, F(2, 194) = 284.08, p , .001, hG2 =
.38, a marginally significant effect of Turning, F(1, 97) = 3.24, p =
.07, hG2 , .001, but no interaction of Emotion 3 Turning, F(2,
194) = 0.77, p = .46, hG2 , .001. Importantly, there was the
predicted Scale 3 Emotion interaction, F(2, 194) = 279.40, p , .001,
hG2 = .33. In line with the results for the full scales, neutral
expressions led to lower ratings than anger and sadness for both benign,
DM = 1.75, SE = 0.15, t(97) = 11.41, p , .001, dZ = 1.15,
and malicious envy, DM = 1.90, SE = 0.10, t(97) = 18.84, p ,
.001, dZ = 1.90. Furthermore, also in line with the full scales,
anger led to lower ratings of benign envy than sadness, DM = 0.92,
SE = 0.13, t(97) = 7.03, p , .001, dZ = 0.71, whereas anger
led to higher ratings of malicious envy than sadness, DM = 3.56,
SE = 0.13, t(97) = 26.88, p , .001, dZ = 2.72. Next to this, there
was no Scale 3 Turning interaction, F(1, 97) = 1.19, p = .28,
hG2 , .001. Nevertheless, turning toward the person as compared
with the object led to higher malicious envy, DM = 0.12, SE =
0.05, t(97) = 2.48, p = .01, dZ = 0.25, but there was no effect for
benign envy, DM = 0.04, SE = 0.06, t(97) = 0.56, p = .58, dZ =
0.06. Finally, there was also a significant three-way interaction,
F(2, 194) = 3.16, p = .04, hG2 = .001, again indicating that the
results pattern differed in strength between the envy scales. In
sum, using selected items, we replicated the effect of Emotion for
benign and malicious envy as well as the effect of Turning for
malicious envy. The effect of Turning in benign envy, however, was
not significant anymore.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Study 2 mostly replicated the findings from Study 1. Inferences
of benign envy were higher when the target turned with a sad (i.e.,
disappointed) or angry rather than a neutral expression toward the
person. Contrary to Study 1, but in line with our initial hypotheses,
inferences of benign envy were higher for sad (i.e., disappointed)
than angry expressions. Yet, this effect was rather small.
Inferences of benign envy were also higher when the target turned
toward the envy object as compared with the envied person. This
effect, however, occurred only for the benign envy scale and not
for the single items in which the envy object was not mentioned.
Exploratory analyses with one item of the scale in which the envy
object was not mentioned also supported that there is no effect of
Turning. This finding implies that inferences of benign envy less
strongly depend on the target’s attention allocation to either the
envied person or envy object. Potentially, only inferences of a few
components of benign envy (desire, improvement motivation)
hinge on the attention to the envy object. However, the different
effects could also be a consequence of more measurement error,
resulting from selecting single items with unknown reliability
from a full scale.</p>
      <p>For malicious envy, Study 2 also replicated Study 1 in that
inferences of malicious envy were more likely when the target
expressed anger as compared with sadness (i.e., disappointment)
or remaining neutral. Moreover, malicious envy inferences were
higher when the target turned toward the person for the scale and
the selected scale item that did not mention the envied person. For
the single item, the test was not significant but tended in the
predicted direction. Hence, as for inferences of benign envy, the
effect of the emotion display was stronger and more robust than
the effect of head turning. However, this change could also be a
consequence of measurement error.</p>
      <p>Notably, Study 2 also replicated that inferences of benign and
malicious envy were generally higher when the target was
emotional as compared with neutral. As in Study 1, corresponding
effect sizes were large. Therefore, simply being in the context of
an advantaged other person may not suffice to lead observers to
infer envy. Instead, the target must be affected emotionally.</p>
      <p>Collectively, these results replicate Study 1 in that they
indicate that the nonverbal expressions of the target independently
contributed to observer’s inferences of benign and malicious
envy. As before, inferences of envy were substantially higher
when a target reacted emotionally to an advantaged other.
Contrary to Study 1 but in line with our initial hypotheses,
inferences of benign envy were higher when the target was
disappointed and when the target turned toward the object.
However, the effect of attention allocation was small and
potentially confounded. Replicating Study 1, inferences of malicious
envy were higher when the target was angry and when the target
turned toward the envied person. To bolster our confidence in
these conclusions, we sought to conceptually replicate them in a
different design using different stimuli.</p>

    <sec id="sec-14">
      <title>Study 3</title>
      <p>The goal of Study 3 was to conceptually replicate the results of
Studies 1 and 2. We primarily wanted to replicate the results in a
between-subjects design, using a more realistic setting than the
design we used so far. To this end, we created pictures of scenes
in which one person looked with either anger or sadness (i.e.,
disappointment) at another person’s superior bike or the person. For
making the social comparison of both persons more explicit, the
emotional person had an inferior bike. Given the strong and
consistent effects of the emotional displays compared with the neutral
expression in the previous studies, we excluded the neutral
expression from Study 3. All participants saw four pictures combining
the manipulation of the expressed emotion and attention allocation
in a within-subjects design, allowing to run the same analyses as
in Studies 1 and 2. We used the first picture each participant rated
for between-subjects tests of our hypotheses. Following the results
of Study 2, we predicted that inferences of benign envy are higher
when the person displays a disappointed as compared with an
angry expression and when the person turns toward the bike as
compared with the person. For inferences of malicious envy, we
predicted the reversed pattern for both effects. We preregistered
our hypotheses, design, and analysis plan on AsPredicted.org

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p>Four hundred ninety-five U.S. workers from Amazon
Mechanical Turk participated in Study 3. Their mean age was 35.67 years
(SD = 11.2, range: 19–73; 311 male, 183 female, one other). We
excluded six additional participants because they indicated we
should not use their data (Meade &amp; Craig, 2012).</p>
        <p>
          We had preregistered a sequential analysis (Lakens, 2014). That
is, we used the R package gsDesign
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(Anderson, 2016; Version
3.0–1)</xref>
          to determine three equally spaced time points at which we
would peak at the data. At the first and second peak, the
preregistered criteria for finishing the study earlier were not fulfilled.
Hence, we continued data collection until we reached the planned
final sample size. To control for the peaks into the data, Study 3
had an adjusted a = .0278. We will consider all p values below
this level as significant. For details on the sequential analysis plan,

        <title>Materials and Procedure</title>
        <p>We invited participants to a study investigating how people
interpret situations. They sequentially saw four pictures in random
order (for example pictures see Figure 6). On the pictures, there
were two persons, each pushing a bike, who just happened to pass
each other on a path. One person’s bike was old and shabby,
whereas the other person’s bike was fancy and neat. The person
with the inferior bike was the target and expressed an emotion.
The four pictures resulted from crossing Emotion (anger vs.
sadness) and Turning (toward person vs. toward bike). As the kind of
expresser did not affect the results of Studies 1 and 2
systematically or substantially (see results of the linear mixed models in the
online supplemental materials), we decided to create pictures of
only two women and two men, in which the same person was
always the target.</p>
        <p>We selected these pictures based on a pretest with MTurk
workers (N = 59). We cropped the heads of the inferior persons from a
larger set of pictures in which each expresser served as target. In
this pretest, participants’ task was to look at each picture and rate
how much the person expresses anger, contempt, disgust, fear,
sadness, and surprise, using a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very
much). For females (n = 20), the selected picture in which the
target expressed anger toward the person was rated at least
marginally significantly higher on anger (M = 5.35, SE = 0.30) than any
other emotion (Ms , 4.48, ps , .053). The picture in which the
target expressed anger toward the bike was mostly rated at least
marginally significantly higher on anger (M = 5.00, SE = 0.34)
than any other emotion (Ms , 4.21, ps , .10), except for
contempt (M = 4.30, SE = 0.39, p = .13). The picture in which the
target expressed sadness toward the person was rated higher on
sadness (M = 5.15, SE = 0.46) than any other emotion (Ms , 3.16,
ps , .003). And the picture in which the target expressed sadness
toward the bike was rated higher on sadness (M = 5.60, SE = 0.37)
than any other emotion (Ms , 3.21, ps , .001). For males (n =
39), the selected picture in which the target expressed anger
toward the person was rated higher on anger (M = 5.05, SE = 0.26)
than any other emotion (Ms , 4.45, ps , .05). The picture in
which the target expressed anger toward the bike was rated higher
on anger (M = 4.67, SE = 0.31) than most other emotions (Ms ,</p>

3.83, ps , .04), except for sadness (M = 4.08, SE = 0.34, p = .30).
The picture in which the target expressed sadness toward the
person was rated higher on sadness (M = 5.46, SE = 0.25) than any
other emotion (Ms , 3.68, ps , .001). And the picture in which
the target expressed sadness toward the bike was rated higher on
sadness (M = 6.10, SE = 0.18) than any other emotion (Ms , 3.37,
ps , .001). Thus, all pictures were valid. Only the female and
male pictures with anger at the bike were not significantly higher
on anger than one other emotion rating. Nevertheless, the pattern
of results clearly aligned with the intended emotion rating.
Furthermore, the female picture was confused only with contempt,
which is an emotion that is conceptually close to anger. Moreover,
even if the male picture was also rated rather high on sadness, the
actual sadness pictures were rated much higher on sadness.
Therefore, we concluded that the entire set of pictures allowed a fair test
of our hypotheses.</p>
        <p>In the main study, participants rated each picture on the English
version of the benign and malicious envy scales from Studies 1
and 2 adapted to the current context. Across the pictures, the
benign (as = .83–.91) and malicious scales (as = .79–.90) were
reliable. Finally, we took the first picture each participant rated for a
between-subjects test of our hypotheses. In line with the
withinsubjects design, there were four conditions, namely anger at the
person (n = 128), anger at the bike (n = 140), sadness at the person
(n = 118), and sadness at the bike (n = 109).</p>

        <p>We first tested our specific hypotheses for different effects of
Emotion and Turning on inferences of benign and malicious envy
for both the within- and between-subjects design. For both
designs, we conducted the same ANOVA. Emotion (anger vs.
sadness), Turning (toward person vs. toward bike), and Scale (benign
envy vs. malicious envy) served as independent variables. The
intensity rating was the dependent variable.</p>
        <p>The results for the within-subjects design are depicted in Figure
7. Because one participant did not rate three of the four pictures,
we excluded this person from the analysis. The ANOVA resulted
in main effects for Emotion, F(1, 493) = 157.40, p , .001, hG2 =
.02, a marginally significant main effect for Turning, F(1, 493) =

Scale was not significant, F(1, 493) = 0.06, p = .81, hG2 , .001.
More importantly, there was a Scale 3 Emotion interaction, F(1,
493) = 359.10, p , .001, hG2 = .06. Replicating Study 2, anger led
to lower ratings of benign envy than sadness, DM = 0.35, SE =

also a Scale 3 Turning interaction, F(1, 493) = 128.83, p , .001,
hG2 = .01. Replicating Study 2, turning toward the person as
compared with the bike led to lower ratings of benign envy, DM =
0.37, SE = 0.05, t(493) = 8.02, p , .001, dZ = 0.36, but higher
ratings of malicious envy, DM = 0.25, SE = 0.04, t(493) = 6.76, p ,
.001, dZ = 0.30. Finally, the analysis also produced an unexpected
three-way interaction, F(1, 493) = 26.56, p , .001, hG2 = .002, again
indicating that the results pattern differed in strength between the
envy scales.</p>

that do not have this confound, as we did in Study 2. The
withinsubjects analysis had three participants less because of missing
data. The ANOVA resulted in main effects for Scale, F(1, 491) =
7.34, p = .01, hG2 = .002, Emotion, F(1, 491) = 177.81, p , .001,
hG2 = .02, and Turning, F(1, 491) = 8.12, p = .01, hG2 , .001, and
an interaction of Emotion 3 Turning, F(1, 491) = 10.88, p =
.001, hG2 , .001. More importantly, there was a Scale 3 Emotion
interaction, F(1, 491) = 375.18, p , .001, hG2 = .08. Replicating
the analysis with the full scales, anger led to lower ratings of
benign envy than sadness, DM = 0.55, SE = 0.06, t(491) = 9.92,
p , .001, dZ = 0.45, and anger led to higher ratings of
malicious envy than sadness, DM = 1.64, SE = 0.08, t(491) = 20.03,
p , .001, dZ = 0.90. Moreover, there was also a Scale 3 Turning
interaction, F(1, 491) = 48.37, p , .001, hG2 = .004. Even though
the effect was smaller as compared with the analysis with the
full scales, turning toward the person as compared with the bike
led to lower ratings of benign envy, DM = 0.15, SE = 0.05,
t(491) = 2.79, p = .01, dZ = 0.13. The effect for malicious
envy, that turning toward the person as compared with the bike
led to higher ratings, even slightly increased in size, DM = 0.35,
SE = 0.05, t(491) = 7.28, p , .001, dZ = 0.33. Finally, the
analysis also produced an unexpected three-way interaction,
F(1, 491) = 37.20, p , .001, hG2 = .003, again indicating that the
results pattern differed in strength between the envy scales.</p>
        <p>For the between-subjects analyses, the ANOVA resulted in
main effects for Scale, F(1, 491) = 7.73, p = .01, hp2 = .02, and
Emotion, F(1, 491) = 12.94, p , .001, hp2 = .03, and a significant
interaction for Emotion 3 Turning, F(1, 491) = 8.06, p = .01, hp2 =
.02. The effect of Turning was not significant, F(1, 491) , 0.01, p =
.99, hp2 , .001. More importantly, there was a Scale 3 Emotion
interaction, F(1, 491) = 72.48, p , .001, hp2 = .13. In line with the analyses
of the full scales, anger led to higher ratings of malicious envy than
sadness, DM = 1.28, SE = 0.17, t(491) = 7.73, p , .001, d = 0.70. The
effect on benign envy was still not significant, yet the effect increased
slightly, DM = 0.24, SE = 0.17, t(491) = 1.37, p = .17, d = .12,
still tending in the predicted direction. Moreover, there was also a
Scale 3 Turning interaction, F(1, 491) = 20.66, p , .001, hp2 = .04.
Even though both effects were smaller as compared with the analysis
with the full scales, turning toward the person as compared with the
object led to lower ratings of benign envy, DM = 0.40, SE = 0.17, t
(491) = 2.31, p = .02, d = .21, but higher ratings of malicious
envy, DM = 0.41, SE = 0.17, t(491) = 2.46, p = .01, d = 0.22. Finally,
the analysis also produced an unexpected three-way interaction, F(1,
491) = 14.23, p , .001, hp2 = .03, again indicating that the results
pattern differed in strength between the envy scales. In sum, these
results show that ruling out the confound of the scales with the
mentioning of the envied person and envy object reduced the effect of
Turning on the scales, yet the pattern remained robust.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Study 3 replicated the results of Study 2. Specifically, inferences
of benign envy were higher when the target expressed sadness
(i.e., disappointment) as compared with anger and the reversed
occurred for malicious envy. Moreover, inferences of benign envy
were higher when the target turned toward the bike as compared
with the person and the reversed occurred for malicious envy.
These results were present in both the within- and
between-subjects analysis with one exception. That is, for the between-subjects
analyses, inferences of benign envy were not significantly higher
for sadness (i.e., disappointment) than anger, whereas the effect
tended in the predicted direction. Importantly, in contrast to Study
2, the entire pattern of results was stable when focusing on scale
items that do not mention the envied person or envy object in line
with our hypotheses. Nevertheless, excluding these items
substantially reduced the effect size of the effect of Turning on inferences
of benign envy. Again, this reduction could also be a consequence
of measurement error resulting from selecting single items with
unknown reliability from a full scale.</p>
      <p>Notably, even though the analyses supported the preregistered
hypotheses, the pattern of results for malicious envy were not fully
in line with expectations. In particular, turning toward the person
as compared with the bike led to higher inferences of malicious
envy only when the target expressed anger but not sadness (i.e.,
disappointment). This, in fact, is in line with our initial predictions
for Study 1. However, as we did not observe this pattern in Studies
1 and 2, it appears to be less robust.</p>
      <p>Collectively, these results replicate Studies 1 and 2 in that
they indicate that targets’ nonverbal expressions independently
contributed to observer’s inferences of benign and malicious
envy. Importantly, Study 3 used a between- and a
within-subjects design, new stimuli, and a different participant pool,
speaking to the generality of the findings. Inferences of benign envy
were higher when the target expressed disappointment and when
the target turned toward the object, even when controlling for
whether the scale mentioned the envy object. In the
betweensubjects analyses, however, the effect of the expressed emotion
on benign envy was not significant but in the predicted direction.
Furthermore, inferences of malicious envy were higher when the
target expressed anger and when the target turned toward the
envied person.</p>
      <p>Three studies support three conclusions about inferences of
envy. First, observers infer envy when the target reacts
emotionally to an advantaged person as compared with remaining neutral.
Second, observers infer benign envy when the target expresses
disappointment and when the target turns toward the advantage as
compared with the person. Third, observers infer malicious envy
when the target expresses anger and when the target turns toward
the person as compared with the advantage. Even though not each
conclusion found full support in each study, the pattern was robust
across the studies. Notably, the studies varied in the kind of

experimental design (i.e., within and between), the kind of stimuli
used (i.e., assembled stimuli and actual scenes), and the sample
(i.e., Dutch and U.S. American), collectively speaking to the
generality of the findings. Thus, a minimal set of expressive displays
combined with contextual information fosters inferences of envy
in observers.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-18">
      <title>Implications</title>
      <p>Interestingly, the pattern of findings is not fully in line with our
original hypotheses. We predicted that inferences of benign and
malicious envy particularly result from the combined effect of the
target’s emotional display and attention allocation. However, the
three studies indicate that the emotional display and attention
allocation have independent main effects. Observers may not need to
interactively combine both cues to infer the targets’ motivational
orientation as either benign or malicious.</p>
      <p>
        Indeed, both emotional displays (e.g., Hareli &amp; Hess, 2010) and
attention allocation (e.g., Frischen et al., 2007) may independently
tell observers something about the targets motivational orientation.
For instance, if observers infer from a display of disappointment
that a target failed to reach a desired outcome
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">(Van Dijk et al.,
1999)</xref>
        , then observing such a display when a target encounters an
advantaged other may suffice to foster inferences of benign envy.
Moreover, turning toward the advantage may imply to the
observer that the target will focus any future motivation on getting
the advantage, again fostering inferences of benign envy
independent of the emotional display. For malicious envy, observers may
infer from a display of anger that the target blames the other
person
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Ellsworth &amp; Scherer, 2003)</xref>
        which already implicitly implies
a focus on the other person independent of attention allocation.
And turning toward the person may imply to the observer the
target will direct future motivation at the envied person. To
corroborate the conclusion that different nonverbal expressions have
independent effects on inferences of benign and malicious envy,
future research should conduct studies with other stimuli.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together with previous findings, the current results suggest that
the social perception of envy is possible, despite previous
theoretical statements to the contrary
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">(e.g., Miceli &amp; Castelfranchi, 2007;
Smith &amp; Kim, 2007)</xref>
        . Observers can accurately perceive envy
when they can integrate information about a target’s experience,
for instance when they judge an acquainted person’s inclination to
react with envy across situations (Lange et al., 2020). The current
results add to this previous research by shedding light on what
cues observers may use to infer envy. Future research should
investigate the entire process of the social perception of envy.
Specifically, do inferior persons express emotions as well as direct
their attention differently when experiencing benign or malicious
envy and do observers then use these cues to infer envy?
Investigating these questions may require having dyads of participants
interact over multiple envy-eliciting situations and measuring
expressed cues as well as envy inferences
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(for an approach, see
Back et al., 2011)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Potentially, such research could also incorporate other cues than
the ones we investigated. For instance, the verbal content of what
persons say or the tone in which they say it may also allow
inferring their envy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32 ref39">(Rodriguez Mosquera et al., 2010; Silver &amp; Sabini,
1978)</xref>
        . In addition, contextual information about how highly
ranked persons display their success (e.g., by showing off) may
also add relevant information observers could use
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref5">(for a starting
point see Brooks et al., 2019; Lange &amp; Crusius, 2015)</xref>
        . Relatedly,
future research could present these cues successively as compared
with simultaneously. In many real-world cases, cues to a person’s
envy may not all be available in the same situation. Instead,
observers probably often need to accumulate information across
situations. For instance, observers may initially see an anger
display when a person receives a bad grade in an exam and may only
learn in a subsequent conversation that the anger was directed at a
successful person who showed off repeatedly. Hence, initially
observers likely infer that the person is angry, whereas additional,
contextual information may foster inferences of malicious envy.
      </p>
      <p>
        More generally, our results contribute to research on the
contextualized nature of emotion inferences. Initial research tested the
recognition of emotions primarily with idealized pictures of
targets’ faces alone
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Elfenbein &amp; Ambady, 2002)</xref>
        . More recent
research emphasizes that contextual cues may change which
emotion an observer infers from facial expressions
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref51 ref6 ref8">(e.g., Aviezer et al.,
2012; Barrett &amp; Kensinger, 2010; Carroll &amp; Russell, 1996; Kayyal
et al., 2015)</xref>
        . In line with this research, our results indicate that
observers may infer a complex emotion such as envy from facial
displays of more basic emotions such as anger or disappointment
together with contextual information. Moreover, we extend this
research by taking into account additional dynamic information
about the target’s attention allocation in addition to facial
expressions. Future research should investigate whether such multiple,
contextual cues may also foster inferences of other complex
emotions such as gratitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        If future research indeed corroborates that emotion inferences
rely on the integration of multiple, contextual cues, this evidence
should also inform practical applications. Currently, industry
develops more and more technology dedicated to recognizing
emotions from isolated cues. Specific software and wearables
specialize in recognizing emotions from facial expressions, vocal
indicators, or physiological changes, yet technology hardly
integrates multiple cues simultaneously
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(Egger et al., 2019)</xref>
        . As far as
we know, context information is never considered. The current
findings suggest that developing technology that integrates
information from multiple, contextual cues will be superior to unimodal
or uncontextualized implementations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the robust support for independent effects of nonverbal
expressions on inferences of envy, our studies also have
limitations that future research could address. First, we did not
investigate depictions of actual enviers. We followed the common
tradition to investigate when observers will infer a particular
emotion from an idealized expression
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(e.g., Elfenbein &amp; Ambady,
2002)</xref>
        . We varied certain nonverbal expressions that previous
research suggested could be present in benign and malicious envy.
In reality, people hardly express emotions fully in an idealized
fashion
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29 ref38 ref5">(e.g., Atias et al., 2019; Reisenzein et al., 2006; Shuster et
al., 2020)</xref>
        , which at least somewhat reduces the consistency with
which observers infer a particular emotion
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">(Sauter &amp; Fischer,
2018)</xref>
        or sometimes even limits observers’ ability to accurately
state whether the person experiences something positive or
negative
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(Aviezer et al., 2012)</xref>
        . Future research could use stimuli
showing people in actual envy situations or turn to actual interaction
studies that we outlined for investigating the full process of the
social perception of envy.

        Second, we had only Western participants. In other cultures,
emotions may communicate different information and hence imply
other inferences. For instance, anger can manifest in different
action tendencies in different cultures
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(Boiger et al., 2018)</xref>
        and
may have different interpersonal effects depending on whether a
participant comes from a Western or Eastern cultural background
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(e.g., Adam et al., 2010)</xref>
        . If nonverbal expressions convey
different information to observers in different cultures, inferences of
envy may differ accordingly. Therefore, future research should
investigate the robustness of these findings across cultures.
      </p>
      <p>Third, even though we controlled for demand effects by using
rating scales and by conducting additional analyses with selected
items, other demand effects may still partly underly the effects.
Future research should therefore further test the robustness of the
findings. For instance, studies should manipulate more emotional
displays and different ways in which targets allocate their
attention. Moreover, they should measure inferences of additional
emotions. In addition, they should use other response formats such as
free labeling. These studies will also provide important
information about the distinctiveness of inferences of benign and
malicious envy.</p>
      <p>
        Finally, we used the sadness facial display to operationalize
disappointment. We based this decision on previous theorizing and
empirical research that implied that both emotions share a facial
display
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18 ref22 ref25 ref48 ref51 ref52">(e.g., Ekman, 1993; Niewiadomski &amp; Pelachaud, 2007;
Van Doorn et al., 2012, 2015)</xref>
        . Yet, equating both displays means
that we cannot know whether any of the effects we found resulted
from a display of disappointment or instead from the sadness
display itself. Future research could assess appraisals that distinguish
the two emotions
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">(for research on appraisal patterns of
disappointment and sadness, see Van Dijk &amp; Zeelenberg, 2002)</xref>
        . This
research should investigate whether observers infer these
appraisals from our stimuli and whether these inferred appraisals explain
the effect of the emotional display on envy inferences
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref34 ref36">(for a
similar approach, see Hareli &amp; Hess, 2010; Scherer &amp; Grandjean,
2008)</xref>
        .
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-19">
      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>The current findings provide further insight in the social
perception of envy. Observers use multiple cues when inferring the
intensity of benign and malicious envy of targets who encounter
advantaged others. Facial displays and bodily changes
independently contribute to these inferences. Together with previous
evidence, the studies therefore imply that inferences of envy hinge on
the integration of multiple expressive and contextual cues.
