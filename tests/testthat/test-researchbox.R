  abstract <- "Are individuals adept at perceiving others’ emotions optimally adjusted? We extend past research by conducting a high-powered pre-registered study that comprehensively tests five theoretical models of empathic ability (i.e., emotion recognition ability) and self-views and intra- and interpersonal facets of adjustment in a sample of 1126 undergraduate students from Canada and 2205 informants. We obtained both self- and peer-reports of adjustment and controlled for cognitive abilities as a potential confounding variable. Empathic accuracy ability (but not self-views of that ability) was positively related to relationship satisfaction rated by both participants and informants. Self-views about empathic accuracy (but not actual empathic accuracy) were positively related to life satisfaction rated by both participants and informants. All associations held when controlling for cognitive abilities."
