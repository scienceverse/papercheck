To our knowledge, no study has investigated this to date.</p><p>It is particularly interesting to investigate how outcome feedback impacts children's cooperation in threshold games. Young children are already able to tacitly and explicitly coordinate their actions with others and enter joint obligations to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Tomasello, 2022)</ref>. In social dilemmas, children in diverse societies begin to cooperate from age 5 to 6 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alencar et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Angerer et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dutra et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Harbaugh &amp; Krause, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Houser et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Prétôt &amp; McAuliffe, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Vogelsang et al., 2014)</ref>. For example, German 6-year-olds cooperated to maintain a common pool resource (water) that would collapse if water levels fell below a threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Koomen &amp; Herrmann, 2018)</ref>. Similarly, German 6-to 11-year-olds sustained a fishing resource for longer when withdrawal was limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ebersbach et al., 2019)</ref>. When failing to reach a threshold would have resulted in a certain loss of endowments, up to 90% of groups of 6-to 10-year-olds from the United States, China, and the Democratic Republic of Congo cooperated <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bowie et al., 2022)</ref>. This suggests that children are able to cooperate and that thresholds facilitate children's cooperation.</p><p>From about 5 years of age, children compare themselves to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Butler, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Steinbeis &amp; Singer, 2013)</ref>. Importantly, children in diverse societies are sensitive to feedback about others' outcomes in middle childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(McClintock, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">McClintock et al., 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">McClintock &amp; Moskowitz, 1976)</ref>. For example, children made more competitive choices in a maximizing-differences game when seeing their own and others' outcomes compared to seeing only their own outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(McClintock &amp; Nuttin, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Toda et al., 1978)</ref>. It is an open question whether outcome feedback will similarly affect children's cooperation in a threshold public-goods game. Middle childhood seems the ideal developmental period to study this, because both cooperative abilities and comparisons with others emerge at that age.</p><p>In our study, groups of 6-to 10-year-olds played a novel threshold public-goods game over eight rounds. Our game used a continuous-contribution mechanism that prevented others from observing the magnitude of individual contributions during a round and thus provided opportunities for free riding without being noticed. To make the game tangible and engaging, we used real water as a resource (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Each child received a water bottle at the start of each round (containing 400 ml water), which was connected to a pool with an artificial animal. The animal was described as thirsty and could only drink if the water reached a threshold (600 ml). Each child (privately) decided how much water to contribute by pressing a tap on the bottle. At least two children needed to contribute to fill the pool to the threshold (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). If the threshold Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Schematic of the water game. Each child sat in front of a water bottle filled with 400 ml water at the start of each round. Each bottle had a tap that children could use to release water into the central pool (transparent container). Bottles were covered in the child's assigned color, and the water level in the bottle was only visible to the child sitting in front of it. The threshold in the pool (600 ml) was marked with a red line, and the "thirsty" animal (a seal) was placed just above it. All water tubes led to a funnel above the pool, obscuring which child was contributing water.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statement of Relevance</head><p>Many real-world problems require people to cooperate, but individuals are often better off by free riding and letting others pay the cost of cooperation. Feedback about own and others' outcomes can undermine cooperation by focusing attention on disparities in gains and encouraging people to outperform each other. However, thresholds that a group needs to reach before it can reap group benefits could attenuate this effect by focusing attention on a common goal. We developed a novel game for children with real water as resource that children could donate to reach a threshold. Six-to 10-year-olds from Germany and India sustained cooperation at high levels, even when provided with feedback about their own and others' outcomes. Analyses of children's communication revealed broad similarities but also nuanced societal variation in line with prevalent cultural models. Clear and unambiguous thresholds can foster cooperation and provide a buffer against the most detrimental effects of social comparisons. was reached, the animal rewarded each child with a water bag (350 ml water) that they could keep in addition to any remaining water in their respective bottles. To incentivize the game, we awarded prizes proportionate to the amount of water children had collected.</p><p>The remaining water in children's bottles was collected in large tubes (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). After each round, children could either visually compare how much water everyone in the group had collected (relative-feedback condition; Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>) or observe how much water they had individually collected (individual-feedback condition, between-subjects condition; Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>). In the relative-feedback condition, differences in outcomes accumulated and become increasingly noticeable over time. If feedback about everyone's outcomes focuses children's attention on their relative position within the group and increases free riding <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(McClintock &amp; McNeel, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">McClintock &amp; Nuttin, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Toda et al., 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Woike &amp; Hafenbrädl, 2020)</ref>, then we would expect a stronger decrease in cooperation over successive rounds in the relative-feedback condition compared to the individual-feedback condition (Condition × Round interaction).</p><p>In middle childhood, cultural variation in cooperative behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Blake et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bowie et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">House et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">House et al., , 2020) )</ref> but also cheating <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kanngiesser et al., 2023)</ref> and competitive behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(McClintock, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">McClintock &amp; Nuttin, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Toda et al., 1978)</ref> becomes pronounced. To study potential cultural variation in children's susceptibility to feedback in our threshold game, we conducted our study in Germany and India. The Indian education system is highly competitive, with grades significantly determining future opportunities and high achievers often celebrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Boucher, 2024)</ref>. Indian children may be more susceptible to feedback about their relative position in a group than German children, and if this were the case, we would expect to find an interaction between condition, round, and location.</p><p>Finally, children could freely talk to each other during the game, allowing us to systematically investigate their communicative strategies and their understanding of the game. Studies with adults have shown that cooperation increases when people can communicate <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Balliet, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sally, 1995)</ref>, but not all communication in children is equally effective in fostering cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Grueneisen &amp; Tomasello, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Koomen &amp; Herrmann, 2018)</ref>. Our coding scheme included verbal coordination strategies (e.g., giving water, goals), use of normative language <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Grueneisen &amp; Tomasello, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2019)</ref>, promises and threats <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Ostrom et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sally, 1995)</ref>, as well as references to fairness, reciprocity, and other relevant utterances (see the Supplemental Material available online for the full coding scheme). Importantly, we also coded whether children uttered social comparisons (e.g., talking about how much water they and others had). If relative feedback about everyone's outcomes focuses attention on disparities in outcomes, we would expect children to utter more social comparisons in the relative-feedback condition than in the individual-feedback condition. Relatedly, if relative feedback made it more difficult to sustain cooperation, we would expect children to increase their verbal efforts to coordinate water contributions. Our study thus provides insight into German and Indian children's behavioral and communicative strategies when solving a novel water-threshold public-goods game and the effect of different types of outcome feedback on children's cooperation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The final sample consisted of 240 children, aged 6 to 10 years: 117 children (39 groups) from Berlin, Germany (M = 7 2 . years, SD = 1 1 . years; 57 female, or 49%) and 123 children (41 groups) from Pune, India (M = 8 1 . years, SD = 1 3</p><p>. years; 63 female, or 51%). Children participated in the study in groups of three, matched by gender and age (a 1-year age gap was permissible), resulting in a total of 80 groups. Half of the groups were assigned to the individual-feedback condition (Germany: 19 groups; India: 21 groups) and half to the relative-feedback condition (Germany: 20 groups; India: 20 groups; betweensubjects design), with gender and age balanced across conditions (for further details, see the Supplemental Material). The sample size was based on previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Koomen &amp; Herrmann, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Woike &amp; Hafenbrädl, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>We excluded one group (Germany) because one child was picked up from the after-school program during the study, and the group completed only four rounds in total. Two additional German groups had missing data for one of the rounds (Round 8 and Round 7, respectively) because of interruptions. Data from these two groups were included in the main analyses. One of the groups (with Round 7 data missing) was accidentally not transcribed; hence, no verbal coding is available for this group. For information on participants who took part in the pilot study, see the Supplemental Material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics and consent</head><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Education and Psychology at Freie <ref type="bibr">Universität Berlin (Approval No. 170/2018)</ref>. In order to recruit and test in local schools, we also received approval from the Berlin School Senate. Only children whose parents had consented to their child's participation took part in the study. Children were asked for their assent prior to participating in the game.</p><p>Additional details about method and materials, including the script used, are available in the Supplemental Material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a b</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Schematic of the water collection tubes in the two conditions (between subjects). Each child emptied any remaining water into a collection tube, marked with the child's assigned color. In the relative-feedback condition, children observed the water levels in all collection tubes and could thus compare their own outcomes to those of others in the group. In the individual-feedback condition, children could only observe their own water level, and the water levels in the other tubes were occluded with removable covers. The relative-feedback condition is illustrated in (a) and the individual-feedback condition in (b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>Children sat at a table about equidistant from each other. Each child was assigned a color at the start of the game (red, green, yellow) and sat in front of a laboratory stand with a water bottle, wrapped in the child's color, at approximately eye level. The water level in a bottle was only visible to the child sitting right in front of it (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Each bottle contained 400 ml water at the start of each round. Each bottle had a plastic water tap and was connected to a central pool in the middle of the table through a plastic tube. The central pool included a marker for the threshold (600 ml) and a plastic toy animal (a seal) near the threshold. We used a large, sand-filled hourglass to indicate the remaining time in each round (90 s).</p><p>Children collected any leftover water from their bottles in large Plexiglas tubes; these were placed on a separate table and marked in children's assigned colors. During the rounds, the water levels in the tubes were not visible and only became observable (from behind the table) by turning the cover around the tube. This allowed us to manipulate (between subjects) whether children observed only their own accumulated water (the individual-feedback condition) or both their own and others' accumulated water (the relative-feedback condition). When children reached the threshold in the central pool, they each received a 350-ml water bag, which they collected in plastic containers placed in front of the water-collection tubes (because each child received a water bag, water bags did not contribute to relative differences in outcome between children). We displayed round numbers with a magnetic board showing the number of the current round and the number of remaining rounds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Two experimenters (female) conducted the study in a quiet room in children's schools, with one experimenter (Experimenter 1) instructing children and the other experimenter (Experimenter 2) assisting with running the study. The procedure was divided into two phases: a warm-up phase and an experimental phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Warm-up.</head><p>Experimenter 1 first demonstrated the watergame apparatus, and children learned how to release water from their bottle and how to observe their bottle's water level. Experimenter 1 also introduced the central pool, pointing out the threshold and the thirsty animal. To help children understand how much water would be needed to reach the threshold, Experimenter 1 demonstrated what would happen if one person tried to fill the pool alone, two people tried to fill the pool, or three people tried to fill the pool. Experimenter 1 also introduced the hourglass that indicated how much time was left in a round.</p><p>Main phase. Next, Experimenter 1 told children that they would play the game over eight rounds and would decide in each round how much water to release into the central pool. Experimenter 1 also explained that each child would keep the leftover water in his or her bottle and collect it in their collection tube. If the group reached the threshold, the animal would be happy and reward each child with an additional water bag of 350 ml. Experimenter 1 further explained that each child would receive rewards proportionate to how much water had been collected (i.e., participants who collected a lot of water would receive many prizes), using a schematic to visualize the relation between water and prizes. Experimenter 1 also demonstrated the water-collection tubes. Depending on condition, children either saw only the collected water in their own tube (individual-feedback condition) or observed the water in everyone's tubes (relativefeedback condition).</p><p>Each round started with Experimenter 1 announcing the round number, turning around the hourglass, and leaving the room with Experimenter 2. Once the time was up, they reentered the room. If children had successfully reached the threshold, each child received a water bag. Children then poured the remaining water from their bottles into measuring cups for weighing (piloting had revealed that weighing water was the most accurate and efficient way to determine how much water remained in each child's bottle). Once each child's water was weighed, the water was poured into each child's collection tube.</p><p>In the individual-feedback condition, each child was privately shown how much water they had collected in their collection tube, ensuring this was not visible to the other children. In the relative-feedback condition, all three children were shown how much water everyone had collected in their respective tubes.</p><p>At the end of the game, Experimenter 1 and Experimenter 2 measured the water in the collection tubes. Children were told that they would receive their prizes once all children in their school had played the game. We used stationery items (pencils, erasers, etc.) as prizes. We deliberately converted collected water into prizes and did not tell children what the prizes would be to minimize potential issues around differences in the perceived value of the actual prizes. Reward equivalency has been discussed as a challenge, particularly for cross-cultural studies, and in recent years researchers have opted to use token or token-like resources (later converted into prizes) for their studies to circumvent this issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bowie et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">House et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>For a detailed description of the procedure and the study script, see the Supplemental Material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data recording, coding, and analyses</head><p>After each round, we measured the remaining water in each bottle and the amount of water in the central pool using a kitchen scale (1 ml = 1 g). At the end of the game, we also measured the amount of water in each collection tube. Two German groups had missing data for one round (Rounds 7 and 8, respectively) because of interruptions. These groups were included in data analyses, with missing rounds coded as N/A. We checked the accuracy of our measurement by comparing the sum of individual measures per round to the final amount of water in the collection tube. There was a deviation in Germany of M = 1 07 . , % SD = 2 68 . %, and a deviation in India of . , M = 1 49% SD = 2 77 . %, indicating very good accuracy.</p><p>We recorded children with two cameras, and transcribed (and, if necessary, translated) their conversations during each round of the game. We accidentally did not transcribe utterances of one German group (the group with missing data for Round 7 water contributions), and hence verbal coding is missing for this group. We developed a detailed coding scheme for children's utterances, and one coder scored utterances of German and Indian children. Across locations we transcribed 16,165 utterances. Of these 14,374 (89%) were scored as codable and 1,791 (11%) as noncodable (i.e., were inaudible or incomprehensible). There were somewhat more codable utterances in Germany (8,203, or 94%) than in India (6,171, or 83%). A second coder scored 25% of groups (3,587 utterances)-balanced by location, age, and condition-for reliability purposes. Reliability was good to excellent for the most frequently coded categories (i.e., &gt;50 scored utterances), κ ≥ .71.</p><p>All data analyses were conducted in R (R Core Team, 2023). We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), as implemented in the lme4 package <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bates et al., 2015)</ref>, and conducted model comparisons to determine the model with the best fit to the data. To illustrate model specifications, we compared the following nested models to analyze whether groups reached the threshold: </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">full</formula><p>For fixed effects in the best-fit model, p values were determined using likelihood ratio tests. To plot model estimates, we used the plot_model function in the sjPlot package <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lüdecke, 2023)</ref>.

The majority of groups in both countries and conditions reached the threshold in all rounds of the game (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">4</ref> and the Supplemental Material), even in the last round of the relative-feedback condition (India: 65%; Germany: 75%). To analyze groups' behavior, we fitted generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) and included reaching of threshold (yes/no) as a response variable and feedback condition (individual vs. relative), location (Germany vs. India), round (1 to 8), gender, and average age of group members as fixed effects. Group number was entered as a random intercept (see the Method section for further details).

In further exploratory analyses, we investigated whether children overshot the threshold and thereby wasted water. Specifically, we defined overshooting as contributing more than 660 ml (110% of the threshold) in a round because there could have been some overflow of water from the connecting tubes even after the taps were closed. We found that a two-way model had the best fit to the data-full versus null: χ 2 9 138 50 ( ) . = , p &lt; .001; full versus twoway: χ 2 1 0 33 ( ) . = , p = .57; full vs. main-effects model: χ 2 3 16 47 ( ) . = , p = .001. Overshooting happened mostly in the first rounds and dropped quickly (see the plots in the Supplemental Material), indicating a learning effect. It decreased more slowly in the individual-feedback condition than in the relative-feedback condition-Condition × Round: Est = 0 46</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Children's communication</head><p>We transcribed and coded children's utterances, resulting in a total of 14,374 codable utterances (89% of transcribed utterances). There were 16 main coding categories, which included, for example, verbal coordination strategies such as referring to giving water or to goals (e.g., "The seal needs to be in the water"), social comparisons (e.g., "I have a lot more than you"), fairness, promises, and threats. We also coded whether children used normative language (e.g., used sentences containing "should," "must," "have to"). Statistical analyses focused on the most frequent categories, and categories that were coded less than 1% of the time were only reported descriptively (see the Supplemental Material for an overview). Because there were more codable utterances in Germany (8,203 utterances, or 94% of transcribed utterances) than in India (6,171, or 83%), we conducted all analyses with proportions (i.e., utterances coded in a category in relation to the total number of codable utterances per participant group; see the Method section for details). The percentage of codable utterances was similar between conditions in Germany (individual-feedback condition: 3,586, or 92%; relative-feedback condition: 4,617, or 95%) and in India (individual: 3,149, or 83%; relative: 3,022, or 83%). We fitted GLMMs with the respective topic as a response variable, and feedback condition (individual vs. relative), location (Germany vs. India), coding category (where applicable), gender, and average age as fixed effects. Group number was entered as a random intercept (see the Method section). As before, we used model comparisons to determine the model with the best fit to the data.</p><p>On-topic utterances. Of the 14,374 codable utterances, 71.3% (10,242) were on topic (i.e., scored in at least one of the coding categories). There were more on-topic utterances in the relative-feedback condition than in the individual-feedback condition, both in Germany (relative: 72.9%, individual: 69.2%) and in India (relative: 74.7%; individual: 67.9%). Model comparisons showed that the full model had the best fit to the data-full versus null: χ 2 5 58 21 ( ) . = , p &lt; .001; full versus main-effects model: χ 2 1 4 57 ( ) . = , p = .033. There was a significant interaction of Condition × Location, Est = -0 16</p><p>. , SE = 0 08 . , χ 2 1 4 57 ( ) . = , p = .033: children produced more on-topic utterances in the relative-feedback condition than the individual-feedback condition, with the difference between conditions being more pronounced in India compared to Germany. There was also a significant effect of gender, Est = 0 09</p><p>. , SE = 0 04 . , χ 2 1 5 93 ( ) . = , p = .015; male groups produced more on-topic utterances than female groups. No other factors were significant (see the Supplemental Material).</p><p>Verbal coordination. To get insight into children's verbal coordination, we analyzed references to giving water, to stopping to give water, and to goals. For each of these main categories, we coded subcategories that included the target of the utterance (e.g., themselves [self], another child [other], or the whole group [we]). For goals, we also distinguished whether participants referred to the group's common goal (e.g., "We have to win") or more generally to the goal (e.g., "If she <ref type="bibr">[animal]</ref> is not inside, this means nobody gets a [water] bag"). References to giving water had the highest overall occurrence (34.1% of utterances). Children mentioned stopping to give water 10.9% of the time and mentioned goals 9.4% of the time, respectively.</p><p>Concerning references to giving water, a full model (three-way interaction) had the best fit to the data-full versus null: χ 2 13 2 082 76 ( ) , . = , p &lt; .001; full versus twoway: χ 2 2 8 00 ( ) . = , p = .018. There was a significant three-way interaction of Location × Condition × Subcategory, χ 2 2 8 00 ( ) . = , p = .018. Children in Germany and India more frequently referred to giving in the relativefeedback condition than in the individual-feedback condition, with the effect being slightly attenuated in India for two of the three subcategories (referring to "others" or "we"; see Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Moreover, Indian children were about twice as likely to refer to others than to themselves, whereas German children referred to themselves and others at similar rates. There was also a significant effect of age, Est = 0 10</p><p>. , SE = 0 04 . , χ 2 1 5 41 ( ) . = , p = .020, with older children referring to giving water more often than younger children. No other effects were significant.</p><p>Regarding stopping to give water, a full model (threeway interaction) again had the best fit to the data-full versus null: χ 2 13 830 37 ( ) . = , p &lt; .001; full versus twoway: χ 2 2 12 65 ( ) . = , p = .002. There was a significant three-way interaction of Location × Condition × Subcategory, χ 2 2 12 65 ( ) . = , p = .002. Again, children in India referred more often to others than to themselves, but children in Germany referred to themselves and others at similar rates (see Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>), with variation across conditions in the two locations. No other effects were significant.</p><p>Analyzing children's references to goals, we found that the two-way interaction model had the best fit to the data-full versus null: χ 2 17 1 073 01 ( ) , . = , p &lt; .001; full versus two-way: χ 2 3 7 74 ( ) . = , p = .052; two-way versus main-effects model: χ 2 7 72 61 ( ) . = , p &lt; .001)-and revealed a significant two-way interaction of Location × Subcategory, χ 2 3 56 56 ( ) . = , p &lt; .001. Children in India were more likely to refer to general than to common goals, and children in Germany mentioned both about equally (see Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). There was also a significant Condition × Subcategory interaction, χ 2 3 13 45 ( ) . = , p = .004, but we are cautious about interpreting any patterns given the low occurrence of some goals (self, other) and the large overlap in 95% confidence intervals.</p><p>For exploratory analyses correlating "giving," "stopping," and goal-related utterances with behavior (e.g. reaching of threshold), see the Supplemental Material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social comparisons.</head><p>Children referred to social comparisons (e.g., "Look how much water you have left.

Predicted proportions (with 95% confidence intervals) of groups' utterances based on the models with the best fit (giving: full model; stopping: full model; goals: two-way interaction model). "Self" indicates that children referred to themselves (e.g., "I give a lot," "I stop," "I have to win"). "Other" indicates that children referred to at least one other child in the group (e.g., "Fill man fill," "Close the tap," "You are not going to win this"). "We" indicates that children referred to the whole group (e.g., "Let us fill that," "We should slowly stop"). "Com" indicates that children referred to the group's common goals (e.g., "We have to win"), and "Gen" indicates that they referred to goals more broadly (e.g., "The seal has to be a bit in the water"). Note that utterances could be coded in more than one (sub)category. We used proportions (i.e., a group's utterances scored in a category in relation to the group's codable utterances), because there were overall more codable utterances in Germany (individual-feedback condition: 3,586, or 92% of total transcribed; relative-feedback condition: 4,617, or 95% of total transcribed) than in India (individual-feedback condition: 3,149, or 83% of total transcribed; relative feedback condition: 3,022, or 83% of total transcribed).</p><p>Children in the relative-feedback condition referred to social comparisons more often than children in the individual-feedback condition (see Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We investigated the effect of outcome feedback on 6-to 10-year-old Indian and German children's cooperation in a threshold public-goods game. Cooperation remained robust for the duration of the game. Observing one's own outcomes relative to others' outcomes (relative feedback) led to a decrease in cooperation rates across rounds compared to seeing only one's own outcome (individual feedback). Nevertheless, the majority of groups reached the threshold even in the last round of the relative-feedback condition (India: 65%; Germany: 75%). This shows that, although children were sensitive to relative feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(McClintock &amp; McNeel, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">McClintock &amp; Nuttin, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Toda et al., 1978)</ref>, thresholds can act as strong focal points for cooperation not only in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barrett &amp; Dannenberg, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cadsby &amp; Maynes, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Deutchman et al., 2022)</ref> but also in children.</p><p>We observed broadly similar cooperative behavior in Indian and German children and no effect of age. Moreover, exploratory analyses provided evidence for conditional cooperation in all age groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hermes et al., 2020)</ref>.

The threshold likely helped children, regardless of age, to coordinate their actions and did so effectively in both locations.</p><p>We observed a small gender effect, with girls cooperating more than boys-similar to what had been found for German children in a common pool-water game <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Koomen &amp; Herrmann, 2018)</ref>. However, there exists no consistent picture in the literature concerning gender differences in sharing and cooperation: Some studies have found no gender effects, and others have shown more prosocial behavior in girls or in boys, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Angerer et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cárdenas et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">House et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Sutter et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Analyses of utterances supported and enhanced the behavioral findings. Children referred to common and general goals (but rarely to their own or others' goals) in both conditions, indicating that groups were focused on reaching the threshold. However, children in Germany and India made social comparisons more frequently in the relative-feedback condition than in the individual-feedback condition-a clear indication that children paid more attention to group members' contributions or outcomes. Children in both locations also produced more on-topic utterances and talked more about giving water in the relative-feedback condition (children in Germany also used more normative language). This shows that children increased their verbal effort to coordinate when seeing others' outcomes and flexibly responded to the different situational demands in the two conditions. Having the opportunity to communicate during the game likely contributed to maintaining high cooperation rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Balliet, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sally, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Although we found broad similarities in communication patterns in response to situational demands (e.g., feedback) in Indian and German children, we also observed cultural nuances in children's communication styles. When talking about giving water or stopping their water contributions, Indian children referred more often to others than to themselves, whereas German children referred to themselves and others at similar rates. German children also verbalized social comparisons more frequently than Indian children. This aligns with previous studies on cultural models that found a stronger focus on others and interpersonal relationships in parent-child interactions in (urban) India than in (urban) Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kärtner et al., 2016)</ref>.
