<p>In this vignette, we will demonstrate the steps towards creating a
module that detects sentences reporting a power analysis. This could be
used for metascientific enquiry, or as a first step in a module that
aims to give advice about whether a power analysis reports all of the
necessary information for interpretation.</p>

<p>First, we need to set up the sample of papers we will code for ground
truth. See the <a href="batch.html">batch processing vignette</a> for
information on how to load multiple PDFs. Here, we will load 250 open
access papers from Psychological Science, which have been previously
read in to papercheck.</p>

(2014), who used identical procedures, materials, and dependent measures.","We determined that a minimum sample size of 7 per group would be necessary for 95% power to detect an effect.","For the first part of the task, 11 static visual images, one from each of the scenes in the film were presented once each on a black background for 2 s using Power-Point.","A sample size of 26 per group was required to ensure 80% power to detect this difference at the 5% significance level.","A sample size of 18 per condition was required in order to ensure an 80% power to detect this difference at the 5% significance level.","The 13,500 selected loan requests conservatively achieved a power of .98 for an effect size of .07 at an alpha level of .05.","Power analysis and sample size.","On the basis of simulations over a range of expected effect sizes for contrasts of fMRI activity, we estimated that a sample size of 24 would provide .80 power at a conservative brainwide alpha threshold of .002 (although such thresholds ideally should be relaxed for detecting activity in regions where an effect is predicted).","This required a second power estimate.","Stimulus sample size was determined via power analysis of the sole existing similar study, which used neural activity to predict Internet downloads of music (Berns &amp; Moore, 2012).","The effect size from that study implied that a sample size of 72 loan requests would be required to achieve .80 power at an alpha level of .05.","Categorical ratings of the emotional expressions in the loan photographs had a similarly powerful impact on loan-request success; requests with \"happy\" photographs received $5.15 more per hour than requests with \"sad\" photographs, on average; they achieved full funding in 7.6% less time.","Thus, simple modifications of subjective features of loan requests (e.g., facial expressions) may have a surprisingly powerful impact on the requests' success, and indeed may have a greater impact than more traditional but costly changes in objective features (e.g., requested amount).","Although previous research has provided mixed evidence about the impact of positive versus negative affect on charitable giving (Andreoni, 1990;Small &amp; Verrochi, 2009), by simultaneously assessing affect at both Internet-aggregate and laboratory-sample levels of analysis, our studies provide consistent evidence that photograph-elicited positive arousal most powerfully promoted lending rates and outcomes (Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 2a, and Fig.","Together, these findings from groups of typically developing children highlight the important contribution of oral language skills to reading development, though only the study of Christopher et al. (2015) included measures of rapid automatized naming (RAN), which is known to be a powerful predictor of the development of word-reading skills (Caravolas, Lervåg, Defior, Seidlová Málková, &amp; Hulme, 2013;Caravolas et al., 2012;Lervåg et al., 2009).","However, the findings provide powerful society-level evidence that is in line with past experimental or opportunity sample research showing that, after contextual threats, liberals shift toward conservative positions (e.g., Nail et al., 2009;van der Toorn et al., 2014).","An a priori power analysis showed that 40 participants per condition should have 80% power to detect an effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.63.","This sample size yielded greater than 80% power to detect group differences of the size we had previously observed in studies of awareness in eyeblink conditioning (e.g., Lovibond et al., 2011).","Furthermore, the effect of go and no-go runs is expected to be much smaller in the unpredictable condition, so much larger sample sizes would be needed to obtain sufficient statistical power in this condition.","Sample size was determined using a power analysis (G*Power Version 3.1.9.2; Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007) based on previous studies that have investigated the link between decision outcomes and self-reported feelings using within-subjects designs.","We determined that a sample size of 59 participants would achieve 85% power to detect an effect size of 0.401 with an alpha of .05.","This approach integrates insights from ultimate (evolutionary) and proximate (decision-making) levels of analysis and, in doing so, provides evidence for a powerful process underlying diverse forms of decision making.","Sample sizes in each study were chosen to maximize power given the constraints of the participant pool, and observed power was generally adequate across all tests (ranging from .55 to .97).","Many psychology studies are statistically underpowered.","In Study 1, we surveyed 291 published research psychologists and found large discrepancies between their reports of their preferred amount of power and the actual power of their studies (calculated from their reported typical cell size, typical effect size, and acceptable alpha).","Furthermore, in Study 2, 89% of the 214 respondents overestimated the power of specific research designs with a small expected effect size, and 95% underestimated the sample size needed to obtain .80 power for detecting a small effect.","Neither researchers' experience nor their knowledge predicted the bias in their self-reported power intuitions.","Because many respondents reported that they based their sample sizes on rules of thumb or common practice in the field, we recommend that researchers conduct and report formal power analyses for their studies.","Reducing the possibility of Type II errors is another important consideration in improving the quality of studies, however: Studies should be well powered (Fiedler, Kutzner, &amp; Krueger, 2012;Simmons et al., 2011).","It has long been argued that researchers should conduct formal power analyses before starting data collection (Cohen, 1965(Cohen,, 1990), yet it continues to be the case that many studies in the psychological literature are statistically underpowered (Bakker et al., 2012;Cohen, 1990;Maxwell, 2004).","Specifically, given the typical effect sizes (ESs) and sample sizes reported in the psychological literature, the statistical power of a typical two-group between-subjects design has been estimated to be less than .50 (Cohen, 1990) or even .35 (Bakker et al., 2012).","These low power estimates appear to contradict the finding that more than 90% of published studies in the literature have p values below the typical threshold for significance (i.e., α = .05; Fanelli, 2010;Sterling, Rosenbaum, &amp; Weinkam, 1995).","Despite the centrality of power in NHST ( Gigerenzer, 2004), formal power analyses are rarely reported in the literature.","Sedlmeier and Gigerenzer (1989) found that none of the 54 articles published in the 1984 volume of the Journal of Abnormal Psychology reported the power of the statistical tests that were presented.","In a more recent and fairly representative sample of 271 psychological articles that involved the use of NHST (Bakker &amp; Wicherts, 2011), only 3% of the authors explicitly discussed power as a consideration in designing their studies.","Thus, it appears that sample-size decisions are hardly ever based on formal and explicitly reported (a priori) power considerations.","Here, we consider another explanation of the common failure to conduct sufficiently powerful studies, namely, researchers' intuitions about statistical power.","In addition, when Greenwald (1975) asked social psychologists what the acceptable Type II error rate was, the average response was around .27, which means that an acceptable level of power would be .73, which again is markedly higher than the overall power estimates for published studies, as reported by Cohen (1990) and Bakker et al.","These results suggest that researchers may intuitively overestimate the power associated with their own research and that of others (i.e., in their role as reviewers).","Given the centrality of power in the debate regarding reproducibility and replicability of research in psychology and beyond (e.g., Asendorpf et al., 2013;Button et al., 2013;Gilbert, King, Pettigrew, &amp; Wilson, 2016;Open Science Collaboration, 2015), we surveyed psychology researchers on their practices, intuitions, and goals related to statistical power.","In our first study, respondents assumed the role of either researcher (reporting on their own studies) or reviewer (assessing their peers' studies) in answering questions about typical and acceptable cell sizes (ns), ESs, power levels, and alpha levels.","In our second study, respondents estimated the actual power of several research designs and the sample size that would be required to achieve a power of .80 in various research designs.","Specifically, here we discuss the respondents' descriptions of how they generally determined their sample size (researcher condition only, because answers to the corresponding question in the reviewer condition were hard to classify) and their assessments of the acceptable Type I error rate, the power level regarded as satisfactory, the cell size typically considered sufficient, and the typically expected ES (in Cohen's d ) for an independent-samples t test.","A power analysis was mentioned by 93 (47%) of the respondents (although 20 of these respondents, or 22%, also mentioned practical constraints, such as available time and money).","Furthermore, 45 respondents (23%) mentioned some rule of thumb (e.g., 20 subjects per condition), 41 respondents (21%) based sample sizes on the common practice in their field of research, and 18 respondents (9%) wanted as many subjects as possible, to have the highest possible power to detect an effect.","As the distributions were not normal and included outliers (histograms and medians are presented in the Supplemental Material), we report the trimmed means (M t s; 20% trimming) and used robust statistics to increase power and to protect against an incorrect estimation of the Type I error rate (Bakker &amp; Wicherts, 2014;Welch, 1938;Wilcox, 2012;Yuen, 1974).","The average reported acceptable levels for α and power were .05 and .80, respectively.","Responses to these questions, in particular, seemed to reflect a common standard, as 83% of our respondents reported that the acceptable α level is .05, and 69% reported that power of .80 is sufficient.","However, for an independent-samples t test with 20 to 25 subjects in each condition and d of 0.5 (medium ES), the actual power lies between .34 and .41, which is approximately half the power that the respondent mentioned.","Considering that 53% of the respondents in the researcher condition indicated that they did not generally conduct power analyses and 23% reported using some rule of thumb, we wondered whether respondents' intuitive power analyses were accurate.","To investigate this, we calculated the power of a study with α, ES, and cell size equal to the trimmed means obtained in Study 1, using the pwr package in R (Champely, 2009).","Such a study would have power of .35.","(When we calculated power separately for each respondent's reported values of α, ES, and n, we found that the trimmed mean power across respondents was .40.)","We also calculated the required cell size given the trimmed means for α, ES, and power, and found that it would be 105 subjects, which is 3 times as many subjects as respondents' trimmed mean for n.","A robust within-subjects Yuen t test (Wilcox, 2012;Yuen, 1974) indicated that respondents' reported acceptable power levels differed significantly from the calculated power based on their responses to the other questions, t(171) = 19.38, p &lt; .001, ξ = .82, 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference = [.36, .44].","We also calculated the bias for each respondent individually (calculated power -reported power).","The trimmed mean bias was -.34; 80% of the respondents showed a negative bias (calculated power lower than desired power), and 33% showed a negative bias with an absolute value larger than .5.","A majority of the respondents in Study 1 reported that power of .80 is satisfactory, and this is the common standard advised by Cohen (1965) and other researchers.","The goal of Study 2 was to measure researchers' power intuitions more directly, by asking them to estimate the power of research designs with α, ES, and N specified.","Additionally, we presented examples of research designs with α and ES specified, and asked respondents to estimate the number of subjects needed to reach a power of .80.","We did not conduct a formal power analysis because we considered this sample sufficiently large for the purposes of estimation.","The first 3 asked the respondents to estimate the power of independent-samples (two-tailed) t tests in three research situations, which differed in the ES (Cohen's d = 0.20, 0.50, or 0.80); α was set at .05 throughout.","In the next 3 questions, we asked the respondents to estimate the sample sizes required for an independent-samples t test to have a power of .80 given expected ESs (Cohen's d ) of 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80; each ES was accompanied by the corresponding correlation (.10, .24, or .37, respectively), and α was again set at .05.","Next, we tested respondents' understanding of what power is with a single multiple-choice question.","Finally, we asked them to indicate how often they conducted a power analysis (7-point Likert scale), to assess their own statistical knowledge (10-point scale), and to indicate their main subfield of psychological research.","Intuitions about power and sample size.","We calculated the true power of the research designs presented to the respondents using the pwr package in R (Champely, 2009); these values are presented in Table 1 and Figure 1, along with the 20% trimmed means and 95% CIs for the respondents' estimates.","Most respondents were not able to estimate the true power values well.","The true power lay within the 95% CI for only one scenario in the medium-N condition (when d = 0.50) and one scenario in the small-N condition (when d = 0.80).","The vast majority of respondents (89%) overestimated power for the small-ES scenario.","When the ES was large and N was greater than 80, respondents underestimated the power of the t test in the design we presented to them.","A comparable pattern was found when respondents estimated the sample sizes required to obtain a power of .80 in an independent-samples t test, given a specific expected ES.","Whereas respondents estimated, on average, that 216 subjects were needed, 788 subjects would actually be needed to obtain sufficient power in the case of such a small effect.","This might be a carryover effect from the questions asking respondents to estimate the power of research designs (e.g., effect of anchoring and adjustment; Epley &amp; Gilovich, 2006).","To explore possible influences on respondents' power intuitions, we looked at the data from both studies.","First, we found that respondents who reported doing power analyses to determine their sample sizes did not estimate power better than those who did not report conducting power analyses.","Almost half of the respondents in the researcher condition in Study 1 indicated that they generally used a power analysis to determine their sample size (although they might not conduct a power analysis for every single study).","The average calculated power for this group of respondents (M t = .46, 95% CI = [.37, .55]) was not significantly higher than that for the remaining respondents in the researcher condition (M t = .42, 95% CI = [.34, .51]).","Furthermore, the amount of bias did not differ significantly between respondents who mentioned typically doing power analyses (M t = -.31, 95% CI = [-.40, -.22]) and those who did not (M t = -.30, 95% CI = [-.39, -.22]).","Next, for Study 2, we used a principal components analysis to summarize respondents' answers to the questions regarding their understanding of what power means (question correctly answered by 168 respondents, or 78.5%), how often they conducted power analyses, and how good their statistical knowledge was.","The first component explained 50% of the variance, and we used hierarchical regression analyses to investigate whether scores on this component predicted estimates of power and required sample sizes.","The dependent variables were the power and sample-size estimates for each presented research design.","We did not find a significant effect of component score on power estimates for the small-ES scenario (b = -0.01, t = -0.98, p = .329).","However, when the ES was medium or large, respondents with higher component scores had higher (and hence more accurate) power estimates (b = 0.02, t = 2.26, p = .025, and b = 0.04, t = 3.94, p &lt; .001, respectively).","Furthermore, when the specified ES was large, respondents with higher component scores gave smaller estimates of the sample size required to achieve a power of .80 (b = -12.89, t = -2.56, p = .011), which again resulted in estimates closer to the true value.","In Study 1, respondents' self-reported statistical knowledge correlated with neither calculated power nor bias.","In addition, robust regression analyses revealed that number of publications did not significantly predict either calculated power or bias.","Finally, we did not find any significant differences between research fields in Study 1 respondents' calculated power (full results are presented in the Supplemental Material).","With a robust 3 (condition) × 9 (research field) two-way analysis of variance using the trimmed means, we tested for differences between research fields in power and sample-size estimates.","It has long been noted that the statistical power of studies in the psychological literature is typically too low ( Bakker et al., 2012;Cohen, 1990;Maxwell, 2004).","Specifically, for studies of effects expected to have the most typical magnitude, respondents overestimated power and consequently underestimated the required sample size.","When asked about how they normally determined sample sizes in their own studies, more than half of our respondents indicated that they did not use a power analysis, which may explain why such analyses are presented in fewer than 3% of psychological articles (Bakker &amp; Wicherts, 2011).","Much research in psychology appears to be planned without formal power analysis, and many researchers appear to use rather intuitive approaches in determining their sample sizes.","In our first study, the calculated power based on respondents' reported acceptable sample sizes and expected ESs was only half of the power respondents indicated they wanted to achieve."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>id<\/th>\n      <th>text<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":5,"dom":"tip","columnDefs":[{"name":"id","targets":0},{"name":"text","targets":1}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[5,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

<p>After a quick skim through the 772 results, we can see that words
like “powerful” or “Power-Point” are never reporting a power analysis,
so we should try to exclude them.</p>
<p>We can use regex to make our text search a bit more specific. The
following pattern requires that power is followed optionally by “ed” and
then by a word border (like a space or full stop), so will match “power”

(2014), who used identical procedures, materials, and dependent measures.","We determined that a minimum sample size of 7 per group would be necessary for 95% power to detect an effect.","For the first part of the task, 11 static visual images, one from each of the scenes in the film were presented once each on a black background for 2 s using Power-Point.","A sample size of 26 per group was required to ensure 80% power to detect this difference at the 5% significance level.","A sample size of 18 per condition was required in order to ensure an 80% power to detect this difference at the 5% significance level.","The 13,500 selected loan requests conservatively achieved a power of .98 for an effect size of .07 at an alpha level of .05.","Power analysis and sample size.","On the basis of simulations over a range of expected effect sizes for contrasts of fMRI activity, we estimated that a sample size of 24 would provide .80 power at a conservative brainwide alpha threshold of .002 (although such thresholds ideally should be relaxed for detecting activity in regions where an effect is predicted).","This required a second power estimate.","Stimulus sample size was determined via power analysis of the sole existing similar study, which used neural activity to predict Internet downloads of music (Berns &amp; Moore, 2012).","The effect size from that study implied that a sample size of 72 loan requests would be required to achieve .80 power at an alpha level of .05.","An a priori power analysis showed that 40 participants per condition should have 80% power to detect an effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.63.","This sample size yielded greater than 80% power to detect group differences of the size we had previously observed in studies of awareness in eyeblink conditioning (e.g., Lovibond et al., 2011).","Furthermore, the effect of go and no-go runs is expected to be much smaller in the unpredictable condition, so much larger sample sizes would be needed to obtain sufficient statistical power in this condition.","Sample size was determined using a power analysis (G*Power Version 3.1.9.2; Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007) based on previous studies that have investigated the link between decision outcomes and self-reported feelings using within-subjects designs.","We determined that a sample size of 59 participants would achieve 85% power to detect an effect size of 0.401 with an alpha of .05.","Sample sizes in each study were chosen to maximize power given the constraints of the participant pool, and observed power was generally adequate across all tests (ranging from .55 to .97).","In Study 1, we surveyed 291 published research psychologists and found large discrepancies between their reports of their preferred amount of power and the actual power of their studies (calculated from their reported typical cell size, typical effect size, and acceptable alpha).","Furthermore, in Study 2, 89% of the 214 respondents overestimated the power of specific research designs with a small expected effect size, and 95% underestimated the sample size needed to obtain .80 power for detecting a small effect.","Neither researchers' experience nor their knowledge predicted the bias in their self-reported power intuitions.","Because many respondents reported that they based their sample sizes on rules of thumb or common practice in the field, we recommend that researchers conduct and report formal power analyses for their studies.","Reducing the possibility of Type II errors is another important consideration in improving the quality of studies, however: Studies should be well powered (Fiedler, Kutzner, &amp; Krueger, 2012;Simmons et al., 2011).","It has long been argued that researchers should conduct formal power analyses before starting data collection (Cohen, 1965(Cohen,, 1990), yet it continues to be the case that many studies in the psychological literature are statistically underpowered (Bakker et al., 2012;Cohen, 1990;Maxwell, 2004).","Specifically, given the typical effect sizes (ESs) and sample sizes reported in the psychological literature, the statistical power of a typical two-group between-subjects design has been estimated to be less than .50 (Cohen, 1990) or even .35 (Bakker et al., 2012).","These low power estimates appear to contradict the finding that more than 90% of published studies in the literature have p values below the typical threshold for significance (i.e., α = .05; Fanelli, 2010;Sterling, Rosenbaum, &amp; Weinkam, 1995).","Despite the centrality of power in NHST ( Gigerenzer, 2004), formal power analyses are rarely reported in the literature.","Sedlmeier and Gigerenzer (1989) found that none of the 54 articles published in the 1984 volume of the Journal of Abnormal Psychology reported the power of the statistical tests that were presented.","In a more recent and fairly representative sample of 271 psychological articles that involved the use of NHST (Bakker &amp; Wicherts, 2011), only 3% of the authors explicitly discussed power as a consideration in designing their studies.","Thus, it appears that sample-size decisions are hardly ever based on formal and explicitly reported (a priori) power considerations.","Here, we consider another explanation of the common failure to conduct sufficiently powerful studies, namely, researchers' intuitions about statistical power.","In addition, when Greenwald (1975) asked social psychologists what the acceptable Type II error rate was, the average response was around .27, which means that an acceptable level of power would be .73, which again is markedly higher than the overall power estimates for published studies, as reported by Cohen (1990) and Bakker et al.","These results suggest that researchers may intuitively overestimate the power associated with their own research and that of others (i.e., in their role as reviewers).","Given the centrality of power in the debate regarding reproducibility and replicability of research in psychology and beyond (e.g., Asendorpf et al., 2013;Button et al., 2013;Gilbert, King, Pettigrew, &amp; Wilson, 2016;Open Science Collaboration, 2015), we surveyed psychology researchers on their practices, intuitions, and goals related to statistical power.","In our first study, respondents assumed the role of either researcher (reporting on their own studies) or reviewer (assessing their peers' studies) in answering questions about typical and acceptable cell sizes (ns), ESs, power levels, and alpha levels.","In our second study, respondents estimated the actual power of several research designs and the sample size that would be required to achieve a power of .80 in various research designs.","Specifically, here we discuss the respondents' descriptions of how they generally determined their sample size (researcher condition only, because answers to the corresponding question in the reviewer condition were hard to classify) and their assessments of the acceptable Type I error rate, the power level regarded as satisfactory, the cell size typically considered sufficient, and the typically expected ES (in Cohen's d ) for an independent-samples t test.","A power analysis was mentioned by 93 (47%) of the respondents (although 20 of these respondents, or 22%, also mentioned practical constraints, such as available time and money).","Furthermore, 45 respondents (23%) mentioned some rule of thumb (e.g., 20 subjects per condition), 41 respondents (21%) based sample sizes on the common practice in their field of research, and 18 respondents (9%) wanted as many subjects as possible, to have the highest possible power to detect an effect.","As the distributions were not normal and included outliers (histograms and medians are presented in the Supplemental Material), we report the trimmed means (M t s; 20% trimming) and used robust statistics to increase power and to protect against an incorrect estimation of the Type I error rate (Bakker &amp; Wicherts, 2014;Welch, 1938;Wilcox, 2012;Yuen, 1974).","The average reported acceptable levels for α and power were .05 and .80, respectively.","Responses to these questions, in particular, seemed to reflect a common standard, as 83% of our respondents reported that the acceptable α level is .05, and 69% reported that power of .80 is sufficient.","However, for an independent-samples t test with 20 to 25 subjects in each condition and d of 0.5 (medium ES), the actual power lies between .34 and .41, which is approximately half the power that the respondent mentioned.","Considering that 53% of the respondents in the researcher condition indicated that they did not generally conduct power analyses and 23% reported using some rule of thumb, we wondered whether respondents' intuitive power analyses were accurate.","To investigate this, we calculated the power of a study with α, ES, and cell size equal to the trimmed means obtained in Study 1, using the pwr package in R (Champely, 2009).","Such a study would have power of .35.","(When we calculated power separately for each respondent's reported values of α, ES, and n, we found that the trimmed mean power across respondents was .40.)","We also calculated the required cell size given the trimmed means for α, ES, and power, and found that it would be 105 subjects, which is 3 times as many subjects as respondents' trimmed mean for n.","A robust within-subjects Yuen t test (Wilcox, 2012;Yuen, 1974) indicated that respondents' reported acceptable power levels differed significantly from the calculated power based on their responses to the other questions, t(171) = 19.38, p &lt; .001, ξ = .82, 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference = [.36, .44].","We also calculated the bias for each respondent individually (calculated power -reported power).","The trimmed mean bias was -.34; 80% of the respondents showed a negative bias (calculated power lower than desired power), and 33% showed a negative bias with an absolute value larger than .5.","A majority of the respondents in Study 1 reported that power of .80 is satisfactory, and this is the common standard advised by Cohen (1965) and other researchers.","The goal of Study 2 was to measure researchers' power intuitions more directly, by asking them to estimate the power of research designs with α, ES, and N specified.","Additionally, we presented examples of research designs with α and ES specified, and asked respondents to estimate the number of subjects needed to reach a power of .80.","We did not conduct a formal power analysis because we considered this sample sufficiently large for the purposes of estimation.","The first 3 asked the respondents to estimate the power of independent-samples (two-tailed) t tests in three research situations, which differed in the ES (Cohen's d = 0.20, 0.50, or 0.80); α was set at .05 throughout.","In the next 3 questions, we asked the respondents to estimate the sample sizes required for an independent-samples t test to have a power of .80 given expected ESs (Cohen's d ) of 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80; each ES was accompanied by the corresponding correlation (.10, .24, or .37, respectively), and α was again set at .05.","Next, we tested respondents' understanding of what power is with a single multiple-choice question.","Finally, we asked them to indicate how often they conducted a power analysis (7-point Likert scale), to assess their own statistical knowledge (10-point scale), and to indicate their main subfield of psychological research.","Intuitions about power and sample size.","We calculated the true power of the research designs presented to the respondents using the pwr package in R (Champely, 2009); these values are presented in Table 1 and Figure 1, along with the 20% trimmed means and 95% CIs for the respondents' estimates.","Most respondents were not able to estimate the true power values well.","The true power lay within the 95% CI for only one scenario in the medium-N condition (when d = 0.50) and one scenario in the small-N condition (when d = 0.80).","The vast majority of respondents (89%) overestimated power for the small-ES scenario.","When the ES was large and N was greater than 80, respondents underestimated the power of the t test in the design we presented to them.","A comparable pattern was found when respondents estimated the sample sizes required to obtain a power of .80 in an independent-samples t test, given a specific expected ES.","Whereas respondents estimated, on average, that 216 subjects were needed, 788 subjects would actually be needed to obtain sufficient power in the case of such a small effect.","This might be a carryover effect from the questions asking respondents to estimate the power of research designs (e.g., effect of anchoring and adjustment; Epley &amp; Gilovich, 2006).","To explore possible influences on respondents' power intuitions, we looked at the data from both studies.","First, we found that respondents who reported doing power analyses to determine their sample sizes did not estimate power better than those who did not report conducting power analyses.","Almost half of the respondents in the researcher condition in Study 1 indicated that they generally used a power analysis to determine their sample size (although they might not conduct a power analysis for every single study).","The average calculated power for this group of respondents (M t = .46, 95% CI = [.37, .55]) was not significantly higher than that for the remaining respondents in the researcher condition (M t = .42, 95% CI = [.34, .51]).","Furthermore, the amount of bias did not differ significantly between respondents who mentioned typically doing power analyses (M t = -.31, 95% CI = [-.40, -.22]) and those who did not (M t = -.30, 95% CI = [-.39, -.22]).","Next, for Study 2, we used a principal components analysis to summarize respondents' answers to the questions regarding their understanding of what power means (question correctly answered by 168 respondents, or 78.5%), how often they conducted power analyses, and how good their statistical knowledge was.","The first component explained 50% of the variance, and we used hierarchical regression analyses to investigate whether scores on this component predicted estimates of power and required sample sizes.","The dependent variables were the power and sample-size estimates for each presented research design.","We did not find a significant effect of component score on power estimates for the small-ES scenario (b = -0.01, t = -0.98, p = .329).","However, when the ES was medium or large, respondents with higher component scores had higher (and hence more accurate) power estimates (b = 0.02, t = 2.26, p = .025, and b = 0.04, t = 3.94, p &lt; .001, respectively).","Furthermore, when the specified ES was large, respondents with higher component scores gave smaller estimates of the sample size required to achieve a power of .80 (b = -12.89, t = -2.56, p = .011), which again resulted in estimates closer to the true value.","In Study 1, respondents' self-reported statistical knowledge correlated with neither calculated power nor bias.","In addition, robust regression analyses revealed that number of publications did not significantly predict either calculated power or bias.","Finally, we did not find any significant differences between research fields in Study 1 respondents' calculated power (full results are presented in the Supplemental Material).","With a robust 3 (condition) × 9 (research field) two-way analysis of variance using the trimmed means, we tested for differences between research fields in power and sample-size estimates.","It has long been noted that the statistical power of studies in the psychological literature is typically too low ( Bakker et al., 2012;Cohen, 1990;Maxwell, 2004).","Specifically, for studies of effects expected to have the most typical magnitude, respondents overestimated power and consequently underestimated the required sample size.","When asked about how they normally determined sample sizes in their own studies, more than half of our respondents indicated that they did not use a power analysis, which may explain why such analyses are presented in fewer than 3% of psychological articles (Bakker &amp; Wicherts, 2011).","Much research in psychology appears to be planned without formal power analysis, and many researchers appear to use rather intuitive approaches in determining their sample sizes.","In our first study, the calculated power based on respondents' reported acceptable sample sizes and expected ESs was only half of the power respondents indicated they wanted to achieve.","The power intuitions of more than 75% of respondents resulted in calculated power that was lower than desired.","In our second study, 89% of respondents overestimated the power of studies with small expected ESs, and 95% underestimated the sample size required for sufficient power when the ES was small.","When the expected ES was small, the true sample size needed to reach a power of .80 was more than 3 times the respondents' mean estimate of the required sample size.","Even researchers who stated that they typically used formal power analyses had poor power intuitions.","In line with earlier work showing the same poor statistical intuitions among general and mathematical psychologists (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1971), our studies indicate that greater self-reported statistical knowledge and experience are not related to better power intuitions in the most common cases (when the ES is small).","Nevertheless, it is possible that some of our respondents were more familiar with other research designs that have different associations between sample size and power (e.g., within-subjects designs are typically more powerful).","However, if experience with research designs had influenced our results, power intuitions should have differed more between subfields that typically use different research designs.","Future research could focus on power intuitions related to other research designs, such as within-subjects and correlational designs.","However, the questions calling for power estimates and the questions calling for sample-size estimates showed the same pattern of results: large discrepancies between estimated and actual values in all conditions when the ES was small.","Furthermore, the response rate in both studies was quite low (26% and 13%, respectively), and researchers who are knowledgeable about power are probably overrepresented in this sample because of their interest in the subject."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>id<\/th>\n      <th>text<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":5,"dom":"tip","columnDefs":[{"name":"id","targets":0},{"name":"text","targets":1}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[5,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

wide range of findings has linked modulations of oscillatory power, phase, and frequency to various cognitive functions, such as attention, language, and memory (Wang, 2010).","The authors built on findings that increased theta power (~4-8 Hz) and decreased alpha power (~8-13 Hz) accompanies the processing of novelty, or \"unexpectedness,\" in the adult brain.","EEG spectral analysis provided partial support for a similar sensitivity of infant and adult brain rhythms to unexpected outcomes: Köster et al. reported a 4-Hz (infant theta) power increase in response to unexpected outcomes.","This effect mirrored the findings from adult EEG recordings, although no effect was found for 6-Hz (infant alpha) power.","Critically, this assumption underlay their interpretation of the bandlimited difference between the responses to expected and unexpected outcomes: Given that theta entrainment took place, the observed difference in oscillatory power must have reflected an effect on infant theta oscillations, in line with theta's postulated sensitivity to violations of expectations.","Here, we argue that both the assumption of entrainment in the first place and the consequent interpretation of band-limited power differences as modulations of entrained oscillations could be versions of the Fourier fallacy ( Jasper, 1948), that is, premature interpretations of frequency-domain effects in terms of oscillatory activity.","Additionally, impulse-like event-related potentials (ERPs) manifest as low-frequency EEG power transients, despite arising from signals that may or may not be related to neural oscillations (Herrmann et al., 2005).","At no point was the power of an \"oscillation\" manipulated.","Although our simulation did not involve modulating oscillatory (SSVEP) power, our results bear close qualitative similarity with the effects reported by Köster et al.","For unexpected outcomes, we observed a frequencyselective theta-power increase during theta stimulation but not alpha stimulation (Fig.","We then created time-frequency plots (averaged over the expected and unexpected conditions), as well as summary plots showing theta and alpha time courses separately for the expected-and unexpected-outcome conditions (baseline corrected as in the original study by subtracting the average power between 1.5 s and 2.5 s with respect to the onset of the flicker stimulus), as in Köster et al.","Most importantly, our model does not incorporate any modulation of band-limited theta (or alpha) power.","Köster et al. report a theta-power increase during 4-Hz stimulation (infant theta range), whereas a similar effect on theta power was absent during 6-Hz stimulation (alpha range) in a control analysis.","Second, note that the control result-the absence of a theta-power (4-Hz) increase during 6-Hz stimulation-stems from a special case.","In contrast to the two main analyses-theta power during theta-range stimulation and alpha power during alpha-range stimulationthe control analysis looks into one frequency range (theta) whereas the 6-Hz stimulation drives an SSVEP in the other (alpha).","This additive model does not assume any modulation of oscillatory power or interaction between the two signals (steady-state visual evoked potential [SSVEP] and Nc), and results in similar amplitudes for the theta-and alpha-stimulation conditions.","The time-frequency plots (left) show power in the alpha and theta frequency bands, respectively, for our additive model when the analysis fromKöster et al.

Moons, 2015).","Gendered power differentials also impact academic spaces in which women are underrepresented and paid less and in which their work is valued less (Gruber et al., 2021;Kaatz &amp; Carnes, 2014;Knobloch-Westerwick et al., 2013;Llorens et al., 2021;Schroeder et al., 2013;Vásárhelyi et al., 2021).","These gendered power differences can be seen behaviorally in departmental seminar and conference Q&amp;A sessions, where, relative to women, men participate more (Carter et al., 2018;Hinsley et al., 2017;Käfer et al., 2018;Pritchard et al., 2014;Schmidt &amp; Davenport, 2017;Telis et al., 2019).","In addition to the choice of whether to participate in Q&amp;A sessions, there could be gender differences in how men and women communicate when at the microphone because of differences in how power impacts communication styles ( J K Burgoon &amp; Dunbar, 2006;Tannen, 1993).","Men are more likely to increase their speaking time relative to their power (Brescoll, 2011;Mast, 2002), which could manifest in men taking longer speaking turns compared with women.","Power can be demonstrated in a multitude of ways, and knowing the scope of gender differences in Q&amp;A-session behavior would inform the steps necessary to create more inclusive spaces.","In Study 1, we coded Q&amp;A sessions from a filmed, single-track, interdisciplinary conference in the United States for markers of participation, whether the idea presented was a question or a comment, how many ideas were presented, and markers of power or dominance in how the attendee asked the question.","Beta oscillations index seconds-long-interval timing (i.e., higher beta power is associated with longer durations).","Beta power indexes temporal durations such that higher power corresponds to longer durations (Bartolo &amp; Merchant, 2015).","Studies on both humans and monkeys show that in time-reproduction paradigms, in which participants copy the duration of an event as accurately as possible, trial-by-trial beta power positively correlates with the length of the produced duration (Merchant &amp; Bartolo, 2018;Wiener et al., 2018).","In such time-reproduction tasks, beta power is stronger for longer durations, suggesting that it reflects the length of the produced duration (Bartolo et al., 2014;Bartolo &amp; Merchant, 2015;Kononowicz &amp; van Rijn, 2015).","Beta power also reflects the subjective length of a duration (Kononowicz &amp; van Rijn, 2015), and beta oscillations may serve as a memory standard to which different durations are compared (Wiener et al., 2018).","A power analysis was performed using G*Power (Faul et al., 2007) to estimate the sample size necessary to generate a medium-size effect of 0.25 with power of .95 for six measurements: time projection (past, future) × type of stimulation (sham, beta, alpha).","The analysis indicated that a sample size of 28 would be required, which we increased to 30 to allow for a 10% anticipated dropout rate and to identify effects of tACS on past and future MTT with a power greater than .95.","We deliv ered tACS using a battery-powered direct-current stimulator (neuroConn DC-Stimulator Plus, Ilmenau, Germany) through a pair of rubber electrodes (5 cm × 7 cm) enclosed in saline-soaked sponges and fixed on the head by elastic bands.","Beta power indexes temporal durations, such that higher power is linked to longer durations (Bartolo et al., 2014;Bartolo &amp; Merchant, 2015).","More recently, Wiener and colleagues (2018) reanalyzed their EEG data from an auditory temporal bisection task, in which participants classified an auditory stimulus as long or short (Wiener &amp; Thompson, 2015;Wiener et al., 2012), and found that beta power covaried linearly with the duration of the previous trial, with higher beta power for longer durations.","Both results can be explained in terms of tACS reducing beta power and therefore leading participants to a shorter memory standard for time durations.","However, as Wiener and colleagues (2018) noticed, the impact of tACS on oscillatory power is highly state dependent, and it is yet to be demonstrated whether tACS enhanced or lowered power in the current study (see also Silvanto et al., 2008).","Hostile sexism comprises overtly negative beliefs, characterizing women as manipulative, power-hungry, and oversensitive.","directly enforces norms of men's power (Bareket &amp; Fiske, 2023), fostering discrimination against powerful women (Masser &amp; Abrams, 2004) and opposition to genderbased policies (Hideg &amp; Ferris, 2013).","In contrast, the patronizing content of benevolent sexism indirectly enforces men's power through gender-role norms (Bareket &amp; Fiske, 2023), undermining women's career aspirations (Kuchynka et al., 2017) and willingness to challenge gender inequality (Becker &amp; Wright, 2011;Hammond &amp; Sibley, 2011).","Benevolent sexism is theorized to facilitate intimacy, whereas hostile sexism maintains men's power.","However, this power dynamic allows the punitive effects of benevolent to manifest within such relationships.","For example, benevolent sexism promotes women's acceptance of their partner's autocratic behavior (Moya et al., 2007) and predicts beliefs that normalize men's power over their partners (Chen et al., 2009).","In addition to testing these two opposing associations, we also assessed hostile sexism, which we expected to be positively related to tolerance of both outsider and spousal violence, consistent with its overt enforcement of men's power (Bareket &amp; Fiske, 2023).","The three items measuring hostile sexism were \"Women are too easily offended,\" \"Women seek to gain power by controlling men,\" and \"In a fair competition, if women lose to men, they usually complain about being discriminated against.\"","We did not conduct an a priori power analysis.","Because of the extremely large sample size, we determined that there was adequate power to detect the hypothesized effects, and we selected a more conservative critical alpha of p = .01.","As expected, hostile sexism was related to greater tolerance of both outsider violence and spousal violence (see Agadullina et al., 2022), consistent with its function of directly enforcing men's power (Bareket &amp; Fiske, 2023).","Our results provide new evidence for a central proposition of ambivalent sexism theory: Hostile and benevolent sexism have distinct consequences that perpetuate men's societal power.","Hostile sexism reinforces such power with overt aggression.","Although the disempowering effects of benevolent sexism are well documented, the implications for women's power within relationships are underresearched (Hammond &amp; Overall, 2017).","It can legitimize men's power over women directly-at least within the traditional relationships that are prevalent in non-WEIRD societies such as India.","High statistical power also meant that our estimates of the hypothesized associations were very precise."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>id<\/th>\n      <th>text<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":5,"dom":"tip","columnDefs":[{"name":"id","targets":0},{"name":"text","targets":1}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[5,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script><p>It looks like a lot of this text is about alpha/beta/theta

Krueger, 2012;Simmons et al., 2011).","It has long been argued that researchers should conduct formal power analyses before starting data collection (Cohen, 1965(Cohen,, 1990), yet it continues to be the case that many studies in the psychological literature are statistically underpowered (Bakker et al., 2012;Cohen, 1990;Maxwell, 2004).","Specifically, given the typical effect sizes (ESs) and sample sizes reported in the psychological literature, the statistical power of a typical two-group between-subjects design has been estimated to be less than .50 (Cohen, 1990) or even .35 (Bakker et al., 2012).","These low power estimates appear to contradict the finding that more than 90% of published studies in the literature have p values below the typical threshold for significance (i.e., α = .05; Fanelli, 2010;Sterling, Rosenbaum, &amp; Weinkam, 1995).","Despite the centrality of power in NHST ( Gigerenzer, 2004), formal power analyses are rarely reported in the literature.","Sedlmeier and Gigerenzer (1989) found that none of the 54 articles published in the 1984 volume of the Journal of Abnormal Psychology reported the power of the statistical tests that were presented.","In a more recent and fairly representative sample of 271 psychological articles that involved the use of NHST (Bakker &amp; Wicherts, 2011), only 3% of the authors explicitly discussed power as a consideration in designing their studies.","Thus, it appears that sample-size decisions are hardly ever based on formal and explicitly reported (a priori) power considerations.","Here, we consider another explanation of the common failure to conduct sufficiently powerful studies, namely, researchers' intuitions about statistical power.","In addition, when Greenwald (1975) asked social psychologists what the acceptable Type II error rate was, the average response was around .27, which means that an acceptable level of power would be .73, which again is markedly higher than the overall power estimates for published studies, as reported by Cohen (1990) and Bakker et al.","These results suggest that researchers may intuitively overestimate the power associated with their own research and that of others (i.e., in their role as reviewers).","Given the centrality of power in the debate regarding reproducibility and replicability of research in psychology and beyond (e.g., Asendorpf et al., 2013;Button et al., 2013;Gilbert, King, Pettigrew, &amp; Wilson, 2016;Open Science Collaboration, 2015), we surveyed psychology researchers on their practices, intuitions, and goals related to statistical power.","In our first study, respondents assumed the role of either researcher (reporting on their own studies) or reviewer (assessing their peers' studies) in answering questions about typical and acceptable cell sizes (ns), ESs, power levels, and alpha levels.","In our second study, respondents estimated the actual power of several research designs and the sample size that would be required to achieve a power of .80 in various research designs.","Specifically, here we discuss the respondents' descriptions of how they generally determined their sample size (researcher condition only, because answers to the corresponding question in the reviewer condition were hard to classify) and their assessments of the acceptable Type I error rate, the power level regarded as satisfactory, the cell size typically considered sufficient, and the typically expected ES (in Cohen's d ) for an independent-samples t test.","A power analysis was mentioned by 93 (47%) of the respondents (although 20 of these respondents, or 22%, also mentioned practical constraints, such as available time and money).","Furthermore, 45 respondents (23%) mentioned some rule of thumb (e.g., 20 subjects per condition), 41 respondents (21%) based sample sizes on the common practice in their field of research, and 18 respondents (9%) wanted as many subjects as possible, to have the highest possible power to detect an effect.","As the distributions were not normal and included outliers (histograms and medians are presented in the Supplemental Material), we report the trimmed means (M t s; 20% trimming) and used robust statistics to increase power and to protect against an incorrect estimation of the Type I error rate (Bakker &amp; Wicherts, 2014;Welch, 1938;Wilcox, 2012;Yuen, 1974).","The average reported acceptable levels for α and power were .05 and .80, respectively.","Responses to these questions, in particular, seemed to reflect a common standard, as 83% of our respondents reported that the acceptable α level is .05, and 69% reported that power of .80 is sufficient.","However, for an independent-samples t test with 20 to 25 subjects in each condition and d of 0.5 (medium ES), the actual power lies between .34 and .41, which is approximately half the power that the respondent mentioned.","Considering that 53% of the respondents in the researcher condition indicated that they did not generally conduct power analyses and 23% reported using some rule of thumb, we wondered whether respondents' intuitive power analyses were accurate.","To investigate this, we calculated the power of a study with α, ES, and cell size equal to the trimmed means obtained in Study 1, using the pwr package in R (Champely, 2009).","Such a study would have power of .35.","(When we calculated power separately for each respondent's reported values of α, ES, and n, we found that the trimmed mean power across respondents was .40.)","We also calculated the required cell size given the trimmed means for α, ES, and power, and found that it would be 105 subjects, which is 3 times as many subjects as respondents' trimmed mean for n.","A robust within-subjects Yuen t test (Wilcox, 2012;Yuen, 1974) indicated that respondents' reported acceptable power levels differed significantly from the calculated power based on their responses to the other questions, t(171) = 19.38, p &lt; .001, ξ = .82, 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference = [.36, .44].","We also calculated the bias for each respondent individually (calculated power -reported power).","The trimmed mean bias was -.34; 80% of the respondents showed a negative bias (calculated power lower than desired power), and 33% showed a negative bias with an absolute value larger than .5.","A majority of the respondents in Study 1 reported that power of .80 is satisfactory, and this is the common standard advised by Cohen (1965) and other researchers.","The goal of Study 2 was to measure researchers' power intuitions more directly, by asking them to estimate the power of research designs with α, ES, and N specified.","Additionally, we presented examples of research designs with α and ES specified, and asked respondents to estimate the number of subjects needed to reach a power of .80.","We did not conduct a formal power analysis because we considered this sample sufficiently large for the purposes of estimation.","The first 3 asked the respondents to estimate the power of independent-samples (two-tailed) t tests in three research situations, which differed in the ES (Cohen's d = 0.20, 0.50, or 0.80); α was set at .05 throughout.","In the next 3 questions, we asked the respondents to estimate the sample sizes required for an independent-samples t test to have a power of .80 given expected ESs (Cohen's d ) of 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80; each ES was accompanied by the corresponding correlation (.10, .24, or .37, respectively), and α was again set at .05.","Next, we tested respondents' understanding of what power is with a single multiple-choice question.","Finally, we asked them to indicate how often they conducted a power analysis (7-point Likert scale), to assess their own statistical knowledge (10-point scale), and to indicate their main subfield of psychological research.","Intuitions about power and sample size.","We calculated the true power of the research designs presented to the respondents using the pwr package in R (Champely, 2009); these values are presented in Table 1 and Figure 1, along with the 20% trimmed means and 95% CIs for the respondents' estimates.","Most respondents were not able to estimate the true power values well.","The true power lay within the 95% CI for only one scenario in the medium-N condition (when d = 0.50) and one scenario in the small-N condition (when d = 0.80).","The vast majority of respondents (89%) overestimated power for the small-ES scenario.","When the ES was large and N was greater than 80, respondents underestimated the power of the t test in the design we presented to them.","A comparable pattern was found when respondents estimated the sample sizes required to obtain a power of .80 in an independent-samples t test, given a specific expected ES.","Whereas respondents estimated, on average, that 216 subjects were needed, 788 subjects would actually be needed to obtain sufficient power in the case of such a small effect.","This might be a carryover effect from the questions asking respondents to estimate the power of research designs (e.g., effect of anchoring and adjustment; Epley &amp; Gilovich, 2006).","To explore possible influences on respondents' power intuitions, we looked at the data from both studies.","First, we found that respondents who reported doing power analyses to determine their sample sizes did not estimate power better than those who did not report conducting power analyses.","Almost half of the respondents in the researcher condition in Study 1 indicated that they generally used a power analysis to determine their sample size (although they might not conduct a power analysis for every single study).","The average calculated power for this group of respondents (M t = .46, 95% CI = [.37, .55]) was not significantly higher than that for the remaining respondents in the researcher condition (M t = .42, 95% CI = [.34, .51]).","Furthermore, the amount of bias did not differ significantly between respondents who mentioned typically doing power analyses (M t = -.31, 95% CI = [-.40, -.22]) and those who did not (M t = -.30, 95% CI = [-.39, -.22]).","Next, for Study 2, we used a principal components analysis to summarize respondents' answers to the questions regarding their understanding of what power means (question correctly answered by 168 respondents, or 78.5%), how often they conducted power analyses, and how good their statistical knowledge was.","The first component explained 50% of the variance, and we used hierarchical regression analyses to investigate whether scores on this component predicted estimates of power and required sample sizes.","The dependent variables were the power and sample-size estimates for each presented research design.","We did not find a significant effect of component score on power estimates for the small-ES scenario (b = -0.01, t = -0.98, p = .329).","However, when the ES was medium or large, respondents with higher component scores had higher (and hence more accurate) power estimates (b = 0.02, t = 2.26, p = .025, and b = 0.04, t = 3.94, p &lt; .001, respectively).","Furthermore, when the specified ES was large, respondents with higher component scores gave smaller estimates of the sample size required to achieve a power of .80 (b = -12.89, t = -2.56, p = .011), which again resulted in estimates closer to the true value.","In Study 1, respondents' self-reported statistical knowledge correlated with neither calculated power nor bias.","In addition, robust regression analyses revealed that number of publications did not significantly predict either calculated power or bias.","Finally, we did not find any significant differences between research fields in Study 1 respondents' calculated power (full results are presented in the Supplemental Material).","With a robust 3 (condition) × 9 (research field) two-way analysis of variance using the trimmed means, we tested for differences between research fields in power and sample-size estimates.","It has long been noted that the statistical power of studies in the psychological literature is typically too low ( Bakker et al., 2012;Cohen, 1990;Maxwell, 2004).","Specifically, for studies of effects expected to have the most typical magnitude, respondents overestimated power and consequently underestimated the required sample size.","When asked about how they normally determined sample sizes in their own studies, more than half of our respondents indicated that they did not use a power analysis, which may explain why such analyses are presented in fewer than 3% of psychological articles (Bakker &amp; Wicherts, 2011).","Much research in psychology appears to be planned without formal power analysis, and many researchers appear to use rather intuitive approaches in determining their sample sizes.","In our first study, the calculated power based on respondents' reported acceptable sample sizes and expected ESs was only half of the power respondents indicated they wanted to achieve.","The power intuitions of more than 75% of respondents resulted in calculated power that was lower than desired.","In our second study, 89% of respondents overestimated the power of studies with small expected ESs, and 95% underestimated the sample size required for sufficient power when the ES was small.","When the expected ES was small, the true sample size needed to reach a power of .80 was more than 3 times the respondents' mean estimate of the required sample size.","Even researchers who stated that they typically used formal power analyses had poor power intuitions.","In line with earlier work showing the same poor statistical intuitions among general and mathematical psychologists (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1971), our studies indicate that greater self-reported statistical knowledge and experience are not related to better power intuitions in the most common cases (when the ES is small).","Nevertheless, it is possible that some of our respondents were more familiar with other research designs that have different associations between sample size and power (e.g., within-subjects designs are typically more powerful).","However, if experience with research designs had influenced our results, power intuitions should have differed more between subfields that typically use different research designs.","Future research could focus on power intuitions related to other research designs, such as within-subjects and correlational designs.","However, the questions calling for power estimates and the questions calling for sample-size estimates showed the same pattern of results: large discrepancies between estimated and actual values in all conditions when the ES was small.","Furthermore, the response rate in both studies was quite low (26% and 13%, respectively), and researchers who are knowledgeable about power are probably overrepresented in this sample because of their interest in the subject.","Therefore, we expect that a more balanced sample would show even larger overestimation of power and underestimation of required sample sizes in research designs.","Poor intuitions about power may lead to incorrect inferences concerning nonsignificant results.","Given the flawed power intuitions we observed, it is quite likely that researchers dismiss nonsignificant outcomes in such studies as due to methodological flaws (i.e., \"failed studies\") or feel inclined to interpret nonsignificant outcomes as reflecting a true null effect, although in fact these outcomes might be false negatives ( Hartgerink et al., 2015;Maxwell, Lau, &amp; Howard, 2015).","First, researchers should always conduct a formal power analysis when planning a study (preferably, such an analysis would be part of an institutional review board's approval or part of preregistration of the study), and they should report this power analysis in their manuscript, together with a description of their sample.","This will force researchers to explicate their samplesize decisions and will likely lead to better-powered studies.","Second, considering that often no appropriate ES estimation is available and that our results indicate that intuitions for exponential power functions are often suboptimal and potentially linear, we recommend that power analyses be accompanied by inspection of the implications of a range of ES estimates, especially at the lower end of this range.","This will help researchers understand the exponential relations involved in statistical power and the considerable impact of seemingly small changes in ES estimates (see also Perugini, Gallucci, &amp; Costantini, 2014).","Third, reviewers should check whether indeed a formal power analysis has been conducted (Asendorpf et al., 2013) and whether it is sound.","Both parties may misestimate the power of studies, regardless of their self-assessed statistical expertise.","There is really only one way to improve studies: power them up.","Results from Study 2: respondents' mean estimate (20% trimmed mean) of the power of the presented research design for each combination of sample size and expected effect size.","The error bars represent 95% confidence intervals, and the lines indicate the true power of studies with the three expected effect sizes as a function of total sample size.","ResultsFrom Study 2: Respondents' Estimates of Power and the True Power for the Research Designs","ResultsFrom Study 2: Respondents' Estimates of the Required Sample Size and the True Required Sample Size to Reach a Power of .8","To get an impression of 9-month-olds' theta and alpha frequencies for violation-of-expectation stimuli, we visually explored the theta and alpha power in existing data before conducting the present study.","Specifically, the evoked spectral power was obtained by complex Morlet's wavelets (Morlet parameter m = 7) at a resolution of 0.5 Hz for theta and alpha for each channel individually (Formulas 1 to 4 in Kaspar, Hassler, Martens, Trujillo-Barreto, &amp; Gruber, 2010).","Throughout the stimulus presentation (0-4.5 s), theta and alpha SSVEPs were significantly above the prestimulus baseline level, both ts(37) &gt; 7.46, p &lt; .001, with higher SSVEP power for entrained theta compared with alpha, t(37) = 3.38, p = .002.","Post hoc t tests revealed a sharp increase in SSVEP power for the onset of unexpected compared with expected outcomes for the theta stimulation, t(37) = 2.85, p = .007, but no difference was found for the alpha stimulation, t(37) = 0.41, p = .684 (Fig. 2b).","A wide range of findings has linked modulations of oscillatory power, phase, and frequency to various cognitive functions, such as attention, language, and memory (Wang, 2010).","The authors built on findings that increased theta power (~4-8 Hz) and decreased alpha power (~8-13 Hz) accompanies the processing of novelty, or \"unexpectedness,\" in the adult brain.","EEG spectral analysis provided partial support for a similar sensitivity of infant and adult brain rhythms to unexpected outcomes: Köster et al. reported a 4-Hz (infant theta) power increase in response to unexpected outcomes.","Critically, this assumption underlay their interpretation of the bandlimited difference between the responses to expected and unexpected outcomes: Given that theta entrainment took place, the observed difference in oscillatory power must have reflected an effect on infant theta oscillations, in line with theta's postulated sensitivity to violations of expectations.","Here, we argue that both the assumption of entrainment in the first place and the consequent interpretation of band-limited power differences as modulations of entrained oscillations could be versions of the Fourier fallacy ( Jasper, 1948), that is, premature interpretations of frequency-domain effects in terms of oscillatory activity.","Additionally, impulse-like event-related potentials (ERPs) manifest as low-frequency EEG power transients, despite arising from signals that may or may not be related to neural oscillations (Herrmann et al., 2005).","At no point was the power of an \"oscillation\" manipulated.","Although our simulation did not involve modulating oscillatory (SSVEP) power, our results bear close qualitative similarity with the effects reported by Köster et al.","For unexpected outcomes, we observed a frequencyselective theta-power increase during theta stimulation but not alpha stimulation (Fig.","We then created time-frequency plots (averaged over the expected and unexpected conditions), as well as summary plots showing theta and alpha time courses separately for the expected-and unexpected-outcome conditions (baseline corrected as in the original study by subtracting the average power between 1.5 s and 2.5 s with respect to the onset of the flicker stimulus), as in Köster et al.","Most importantly, our model does not incorporate any modulation of band-limited theta (or alpha) power.","Köster et al. report a theta-power increase during 4-Hz stimulation (infant theta range), whereas a similar effect on theta power was absent during 6-Hz stimulation (alpha range) in a control analysis.","Second, note that the control result-the absence of a theta-power (4-Hz) increase during 6-Hz stimulation-stems from a special case.","In contrast to the two main analyses-theta power during theta-range stimulation and alpha power during alpha-range stimulationthe control analysis looks into one frequency range (theta) whereas the 6-Hz stimulation drives an SSVEP in the other (alpha).","This additive model does not assume any modulation of oscillatory power or interaction between the two signals (steady-state visual evoked potential [SSVEP] and Nc), and results in similar amplitudes for the theta-and alpha-stimulation conditions.","The time-frequency plots (left) show power in the alpha and theta frequency bands, respectively, for our additive model when the analysis fromKöster et al. (2019) is applied.","The graphs (right) show power in response to the expected and unexpected outcomes, separately for the alpha-and theta-stimulation conditions.","The inset shows results from the same theta-power control analysis as run by Köster et al. a.u. = arbitrary units.","This additive model does not assume any modulation of oscillatory power or interaction between the two signals (steady-state visual evoked potential [SSVEP] and Nc), and results in similar amplitudes for the theta-and alpha-stimulation conditions.","The time-frequency plots (left) show power in the alpha and theta frequency bands, respectively, for our additive model when the analysis fromKöster et al.

</h3>
<p>Once you have the ground truth coded from your best inclusive search
term, you can validate your module and start trying to improve its
performance.</p>
<p>First, let’s use the over-inclusive search term. This will, by
definition, have no false negatives, but further refining of your module
will start to produce both false positives and negatives.</p>
<p>You have to set up two files to match the module output. First, a
table of the expected text matches. You can get this by filtering your
ground truth table to just the rows that are true positives (hand-coded
here as the column <code>power_computation</code>).</p>

<p>This version has the same overall accuracy by paper, but fewer false
positives and more false negatives. False positives in the context of a
module that informs scientists about a potential problem are not
necessarily undesirable. It may be better to be over-sensitive and catch
almost all problems, even if you also catch many non-problems. You will
need to evaluate the validation results in the context of what you want
your module to do.</p>

<p>Let’s try a two-step process for finding sentences with the word
power that also have numbers or percents.</p>

<p>It’s definitely doing better than the last version. Can you refine it
to do even better?</p>
