1.  Novel object task. Lemurs will be presented with a series of novel items (baseline, person, stationary object, moving object). For each item, we will measure lemurs’ latency to approach and their interest in each item.<br />
2. Quantity discrimination task. Lemurs will make choices between smaller and larger pieces of food. We will measure choices for the larger piece.<br />
3. Persistence task. Lemurs will be presented with a piece of food in a box that is impossible to access. We will measure how many times and for how long subjects interact with the box.<br />
4. Temporal discounting task. Lemurs will be presented with a series of choices between a smaller piece of food immediately available and a larger piece of the same food available after a delay. We will measure their choices for the larger delayed option.<br />
5. A-not-B error task. Lemurs will be first familiarized with finding food at a container in one location (A), and then in the test trial visibly see the food moved from A to a new container (B). We will measure lemurs’ choices for the correct location (B).<br />
6. Working memory task. Lemurs will see the experimenter hide food under one of 3 identical containers; after a 5s delay with occlusion, lemurs can choose one of the cups. We will measure their choices for the correct location.<br />
7. Reversal learning task. Lemurs will be presented with two containers (different colors and locations). They will first learn that one container provides a food reward (whereas the other is always empty). Once they learn this, the reward contingencies will be switched in the test trials. We will measure responses for the correct option in the learning and test trials.<BR><BR><B>4) How many and which conditions will participants be assigned to?</B><BR>  This study does not have conditions: all individuals will complete the same tasks in the same order to assess species-level and individual-level variation in these cognitive abilities.<BR><BR><B>5) Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/hypothesis.</B><BR>  First, we will examine whether differences in species’ socio-ecology predict variation in subjects’ performance in a battery of cognitive tests that tap into several component executive functions. To do this, we will use generalized linear mixed models to analyze species’ performance in each separate task. For each task, the dependent variable will be correct choices in that task, and the test predictor will be species. We will include subject ID as a random factor, and control for age, sex and trial number in models as relevant. Across analyses, we will compare the fit of different models using likelihood-ratio tests. In addition, we will also examine each individual’s performance across the cognitive tasks, to examine whether performance on a given cognitive task predicts performance in other tasks. To do so we will first use pairwise bivariate correlations across all individuals as well as partitioning by species. If there were significant age-related variation in cognitive performance in tasks in the first phase of analyses, we will also use linear regressions accounting for age. Second, we will use a factor analysis to detect whether performance in different task co-vary across individuals (overall, and within each species).<BR><BR><B>6) Describe exactly how outliers will be defined and handled, and your precise rule(s) for excluding observations.</B><BR>  For each task, individuals will be excluded from relevant analyses if they fail to complete the task for three consecutive attempts. Any individual who fails to complete 1 or more cognitive task, will be excluded from the relevant analyses requiring that data, and we will check if including them affects other results.<BR><BR><B>7) How many observations will be collected or what will determine sample size?<BR><font size='2'> No need to justify decision, but be precise about <u>exactly</u> how the number will be determined.</font></B><BR>  The study will compare four lemur species: ruffed lemur, Coquerel’s sifakas, ring-tailed lemur and mongoose lemur at the Duke Lemur Center. We will test a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 15 individuals for each species based on availability and individual’s willingness to participate at the time of testing.<BR><BR><B>8) Anything else you would like to pre-register? <BR><font size='2'>(e.g., secondary analyses, variables collected for exploratory purposes, unusual analyses planned?)</font></B><BR>  Nothing else to pre-register.<BR><BR><div style='text-align:right;font-size:70%;color:gray;'>Version of AsPredicted Questions: 2.00</div></div><center><div id='footer' style='margin-bottom:30px;' ><hr><a href='http://credlab.wharton.upenn.edu' target='_blank'><img src='https://aspredicted.org/images/CredLab Logo 2020_transparent.svg' width='165'></a><BR><BR><span style='font-size:small;'><a href='mailto:support@aspredicted.org?subject=I would like to report a bug'>Report a bug</a>  &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='mailto:support@aspredicted.org?subject=I have a suggestion for ResearchBox'>Make a suggestion</a>  &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='https://aspredicted.org/terms@'>Terms of use</a>       &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='https://aspredicted.org/help'>Help</a>       &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='https://aspredicted.org/about@'>About</a><BR><BR></center></div></div><script src='https://aspredicted.org/js/shared/main.js?version_date=1752905264' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='https://aspredicted.org/js/footer.js?version_date=1727788481' type='text/javascript'></script>
