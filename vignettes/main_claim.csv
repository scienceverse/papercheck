This suggests that being surrounded by people who see the world differently, even if they are friends, may be a risk factor for loneliness.",5.05e-4,"Loneliness is detrimental to well-being and is often accompanied by self-reported feelings of not being understood by other people. What contributes to such feelings in lonely people? We used functional MRI of 66 first-year university students to unobtrusively measure the relative alignment of people's mental processing of naturalistic stimuli and tested whether lonely people actually process the world in idiosyncratic ways. We found evidence for such idiosyncrasy: Lonely individuals' neural responses were dissimilar to those of their peers, particularly in regions of the default-mode network in which similar responses have been associated with shared perspectives and subjective understanding. These relationships persisted when we controlled for demographic similarities, objective social isolation, and individuals' friendships with each other. Our findings raise the possibility that being surrounded by people who see the world differently from oneself, even if one is friends with them, may be a risk factor for loneliness.",abstract,Abstract,0,NA,NA

Throughout history, people have worried about the potentially harmful implications and applications of scientific findings (Shattuck, 1997), which inevitably sways scientists' decisions about what (or what not) to study (Kempner et al., 2005). We tested the hypothesis that people systematically overestimate harmful reactions to behavioral science research. Human cognition exhibits numerous systematic judgmental biases (Kahneman, 2011). Evolutionary theorists have, however, countered that some biases should be viewed not as bugs but as design features that promote fitness in environments in which certain errors are costlier than others (Haselton et al., 2016). For example, people are hyperactive agency detectors (Barrett, 2000). Failing to detect that a rustle in the bushes signals the presence of a predator (false negative) is costlier than concluding that the rustle was caused by a predator and unnecessarily elevating one's defenses (false positive), and so unexpected creaks and cracks put us on edge-usually erroneously. Hyperactive agency detection is a subtype of bias toward harm avoidance. From a very young age, humans attend to threatening stimuli (LoBue et al., 2017). Losses and negative events have greater impact on human judgment than gains and positive events of similar magnitude (Baumeister et al., 2001;Rozin & Royzman, 2001;Tversky & Kahneman, 1991).

However, wealthy countries often pursue nationalistic policies, stockpiling doses rather than redistributing them globally. One possible motivation behind vaccine nationalism is a belief among policymakers that citizens will mistrust leaders who prioritize global needs over domestic protection. In seven experiments (total N = 4,215 adults), we demonstrate that such concerns are misplaced: Nationally representative samples across multiple countries with large vaccine surpluses (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and United States) trusted redistributive leaders more than nationalistic leaderseven the more nationalistic participants. This preference generalized across different diseases and manifested in both self-reported and behavioral measures of trust. Professional civil servants, however, had the opposite intuition and predicted higher trust in nationalistic leaders, and a nonexpert sample also failed to predict higher trust in redistributive leaders.

However, meaningful and meaningless stimuli typically differ perceptually, and objects' associations with meaning are usually already established outside the laboratory, potentially confounding experimental findings.

This phase was preceded and followed by a (preand postlearning) change-detection task to assess VWM performance. The results revealed that short-term retention was enhanced after learning, particularly for meaning-associated characters, although participants did not quite reach the accuracy level attained by native Chinese observers (young adults, N = 20).

Throughout development, children acquire knowledge, skills, and attitudes by modeling other individuals (e.g., Bandura, 1986).

Classrooms are no exception: The social dynamics among students and between students and teachers have a profound impact on students' engagement, learning, and well-being (Hamre & Pianta, 2006). Recent research suggests that the mere presence of other students in the classroom can impact students' attentiveness and learning (Forrin et al., 2021).

In a series of experiments, we found that young adults encoded at a faster rate when they were adapted to overall and recent stimulus duration.

desiraju-dietvorst-2023-reason-defaults-presenting-defaults-with-reasons-for-choosing-each-option-helps-decision-makers.pdf.tei.xml,"The main claim of this paper is that default options have a significant impact on people's behavior and decision-making, and that they may not always be the best option for all individuals, particularly those with minority interests. The paper discusses how defaults can lead individuals to save more than they intended, but also how defaults can favor culturally masculine interests and potentially disadvantage other genders. It also highlights the potential for defaults to lead people with minority interests into suboptimal options.",8.06e-4,"Choices with a default specify one option that is chosen automatically unless the decision-maker selects an alternative. For example, many employees are defaulted into participating in their company's 401(k) plan, so they will accrue retirement savings even if they take no action. Defaults are powerful tools for nudging individuals toward a specific option and have been used to lift many ostensibly beneficial behaviors (Thaler & Benartzi, 2004;Thaler & Sunstein, 2008). For instance, countries that enroll citizens as organ donors by default tend to have far greater rates of organ donation ( Johnson & Goldstein, 2003). Further, people are significantly more likely to get a flu vaccine when they are defaulted into a scheduled appointment instead of having to opt in (Chapman et al., 2010). Choice architects typically select the option that is best for most people to be the default. For example, employees are defaulted into retirement savings programs because most people do not save enough for retirement (Beshears et al., 2016;Lusardi, 2001). However, people often have heterogeneous interests, meaning the default may not be the best option for all individuals (Sunstein, 2013). As a result, people with minority interests may be defaulted into suboptimal options (Beshears et al., 2016;Carroll et al., 2009;Cheryan & Markus, 2020;Choi et al., 2002). For example, in a study of 401(k) enrollment across three firms, 67.7% of employees thought they were saving too little, and only a third of these employees intended to save more in the near future. However, once a savings plan with a greater contribution was made the default option, uptake of the plan exceeded 85% (Choi et al., 2002), suggesting that this default led some individuals to save more than they intended. Other work has found that defaults often favor culturally masculine interests, potentially to the disadvantage of other genders (Cheryan & Markus, 2020).",abstract,Abstract,0,NA,NA
dufner-krause-2023-on-how-to-be-liked-in-first-encounters-the-effects-of-agentic-and-communal-behaviors-on-popularity.pdf.tei.xml,"The main claim of this paper is that there are two forms of being liked by others: general popularity and unique liking. Both forms are important for social inclusion, mental health, and well-being, and they can be influenced by individual behavior in specific dyadic interactions.",6.99e-4,"When meeting other people for the first time, how should one behave if one's goal is to be liked? Even though this question is straightforward, it requires a nuanced answer. According to Kenny's (1994) social relations model, the effects of interpersonal behavior on liking can be examined on two levels. On the level of the individual, one can examine whether persons' general tendency to exhibit a certain behavior predicts the extent to which they are generally liked by others. This form of being liked is called popularity (Back & Kenny, 2010) and describes the target effect of the social relations model analysis with regard to being liked. On the level of the dyad, one can examine whether individuals who display more of a specific behavior than what is typical for them are particularly well-liked by their interaction partner in specific dyadic interactions. This form of being liked by others is called unique liking (Back & Kenny, 2010), and in the terminology of the social relations model, it represents the relationship effect with regard to being liked. Both kinds of being liked are important for theoretical and practical reasons. Popularity safeguards social inclusion in the group, which was crucial for survival in our evolutionary past and is still highly important for mental health and well-being today (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). Above and beyond general popularity, the other form of being liked, unique liking, is highly consequential of mutually supportive dyadic relationships that are omnipresent in social life (e.g., friendships, partnerships, or romantic relationships) and that are adaptive in evolutionary terms (Hruschka, 2010). In such relationships, unique liking is typically reciprocated, meaning that the more person A likes person B, the more person B tends to like person A (Kenny, 2020), and this dyadic liking-based bond is crucial for keeping relationships together (e.g., Hays, 1984).",abstract,Abstract,0,NA,NA

Importantly, political partisanship predicts not only voting-related outcomes (Bartels, 2000) but also important nonvoting outcomes such as economic behavior (Gerber & Huber, 2009), religious beliefs (Margolis, 2018), or media use (Iyengar & Hahn, 2009). Of all potential outcomes, whether political partisanship is associated with a longer life is arguably the most consequential one. Evidence from the United States suggests that political partisanship is linked to mortality. Specifically, studies found that Republicans are healthier (Subramanian & Perkins, 2010) and live longer (Kannan et al., 2019;Pabayo et al., 2015) than Democrats. Recent estimates indicate that Republicans (at any given point in their lives) have a 21% lower mortality risk than Democrats (Kannan et al., 2019). Different explanations have been discussed to understand why Republicans are healthier and live longer. For example, some researchers have suggested that Republicans are of higher socioeconomic status and engage more in health-promoting behaviors (such as religious activities and civic participation; Subramanian et al., 2009), better cope with injustices (Pabayo et al., 2015), or feel more personally responsible for their health (Chan, 2019;Kannan et al., 2019). Importantly, all of these explanations share the assumption of a universal link between partisanship and longevity (i.e., that all Republicans enjoy longevity benefits to a similar degree).

We developed a contour model of aesthetics that assigns values to visual properties in scenes, allowing us to predict aesthetic responses in adults from around the world. Through a series of experiments, we manipulate contours to increase or decrease aesthetic value while preserving scene semantic identity. Contour manipulations directly shift subjective aesthetic judgments. This provides the first experimental evidence for a causal relationship between contour properties and aesthetic valuation.

Given numerous anecdotal and scientific reports of distorted time perception during the pandemic (Martinelli et al., 2021;Ogden, 2020Ogden,, 2021)), the current study addressed this important question in an international sample of adults from two phases of the adult life span, early in the COVID-19 pandemic (May 2020). Temporal horizons are ubiquitous in human experience; our integration of past and future influences our present-moment behavior (Lewin, 1942). Although the experience of psychological time is a fairly stable individual difference (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999), it also changes dynamically with situational and psychological factors, such as time constraints (Gable & Poole, 2012).

To investigate this, we had healthy young adults encode novel items while simultaneously following a sequence of actions (key presses) that was either predictable and well-learned or random. Across three experiments (N = 80 each), we found that temporal order memory, but not item memory, was significantly enhanced for novel items encoded while participants executed predictable compared with random action sequences.

This question is important for a theoretical understanding of the precursors of general functioning and because of its implications for training and feedback in education and in the workplace. From a theoretical standpoint, knowledge of how empathic accuracy relates to adjustment is necessary to fully understand the functions of this ability and the antecedents of optimal functioning. From a practical perspective, knowing whether empathic accuracy facilitates adjustment informs the content of training and feedback interventions, as findings that higher empathic accuracy relates to better adjustment would suggest another reason to formally train this ability. Empathic accuracy for emotions-the ability to correctly identify the emotions that others feel 1 (Ickes et al., 1990;Levenson & Ruef, 1992)-could relate to higher adjustment by helping people coordinate their actions with others, respond to others' unstated needs, and develop strong relationships (Gleason et al., 2009). Alternatively, reading others well could lead people to discover information that is challenging and negatively impacts adjustment, such as whether others truly like them (Elfenbein & Ambady, 2002;Simpson et al., 2003). Empathic accuracy might also relate to adjustment in more complex ways that involve how good people think they are at reading others (He & Côté, 2019;Humberg et al., 2019). The literature on abilities and adjustment distinguishes between ability (as assessed by performance on objective tests) and self-views of those abilities (as assessed by impressions of one's performance on tests or during social interactions; Salovey et al., 2002).

This avoidance leads to a combination of flexibility and inflexibility in problem solving.,4.8400000000000006e-4,"Planning underpins the impressive flexibility of goal-directed behavior. However, even when planning, people can display surprising rigidity in how they think about problems (e.g., ""functional fixedness"") that lead them astray. How can our capacity for behavioral flexibility be reconciled with our susceptibility to conceptual inflexibility? We propose that these tendencies reflect avoidance of two cognitive costs: the cost of representing task details and the cost of switching between representations. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel paradigm that affords participants opportunities to choose different families of simplified representations to plan. In two preregistered, online studies (Ns = 377 and 294 adults), we found that participants' optimal behavior, suboptimal behavior, and reaction time were explained by a computational model that formalized people's avoidance of representational complexity and switching.

These judgments are made quickly and often without conscious awareness (Bar et al., 2006;Willis & Todorov, 2006). Data-driven methods have identified sets of features that are most predictive of specific trait impressions (Oosterhof & Todorov, 2008). These features effectively serve as facial stereotypes and have been linked to severe downstream consequences. For example, faces that are perceived as untrustworthy are associated with more negative outcomes in hiring, political elections, and criminal sentencing (Olivola et al., 2014;Wilson & Rule, 2015, 2016). Although these face-based judgments are made very consistently across perceivers, they have little correspondence with actual personality or behavior (Krendl et al., 2014), suggesting that these facial stereotypes can inadvertently influence consequential social judgments. Given the inaccuracy of facial stereotypes, it is important to explore approaches that can curb their real-world impact. However, face-based judgments have generally been impervious to interventions. Learning that appearances are nonpredictive of actual trustworthiness does not seem to decrease their use ( Jaeger et al., 2019), nor does the knowledge of an individual's past behavior (Rezlescu et al., 2012).

These perspectives suggest that decision-makers are primarily driven by restoring fairness by enacting an appropriate punishment vis-à-vis the crime (Mooijman & Graham, 2018). However, there are times when individuals cannot immediately administer punishment to transgressors. Indeed, time delays-or gaps between when a crime was committed and when a transgressor experiences punishment-are frequent and common. 1 For example, government agencies often fail to immediately sanction citizens for lying on their tax returns because they lack the resources to detect fraud when it happens (Brickner et al., 2010). Similarly, overburdened police departments with limited resources often prioritize certain crimes over others, leading to time delays in convicting criminals (Martin & Sherman, 1986). Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has generated a significant backlog of court cases (Witte & Berman, 2021). Despite the ubiquity of time delays in enacting justice, normative perspectives on punishment (Treviño & Weaver, 1998) suggest that time delays should be irrelevant when determining punishment severity.

Relevant empirical work has focused on explicit (self-reported) evaluations of victims of harm (Hafer, 2000;Lerner & Miller, 1978). In these studies, participants often report negative evaluations of victims of unjust suffering, presumably to reduce cognitive dissonance. However, explicit victim derogation is not ubiquitous: Jordan and Kouchaki (2021) have provided evidence for positive shifts in explicit evaluations of individuals who become victims of harm. Critically, even when explicit victim evaluations are positive, implicit (automatic) evaluations need not be, for at least two reasons. First, explicit victim evaluations cannot be taken at face value given social desirability concerns (Hafer",abstract,Abstract,0,NA,NA
lai-lisnek-2023-the-impact-of-implicit-bias-oriented-diversity-training-on-police-officers-beliefs-motivations-and.pdf.tei.xml,The main claim of this paper is that there is a need for empirical evaluation and psychological research on bias reduction in diversity training programs for police officers in order to mitigate the impact of implicit biases on their behavior towards Black individuals. The paper also highlights the unequal treatment of Black individuals by police officers in the United States and the role of implicit biases in driving these inequities.,6.990000000000001e-4,"At almost any point of contact between police officers and Black individuals in the United States, there is evidence of unequal treatment. U.S. police officers are more likely to stop, question, arrest, injure, or kill Black people than White people (Glaser, 2015). Subtle or implicit biases have been identified as a psychological mechanism underlying these inequities in police behavior (Spencer et al., 2016). These implicit biases may cause police officers to perceive Black people as more dangerous than is warranted. For instance, a laboratory experiment found that police recruits are more likely to shoot unarmed Black men than unarmed White men in simulated ambiguous scenarios (Ma et al., 2013). Police officers are armed by the state to ensure public safety, and yet their actions often fall short of doing so equitably. Recognizing these disparities, police departments across the United States have stepped up their efforts to reduce racial inequities with bias-training programs (President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing, 2015). Of particular interest is the rise of implicit-bias-oriented diversity training programs that educate police about implicit bias and provide strategies to mitigate the impact of that bias on behavior. A survey of 109 U.S. police departments in large metropolitan areas indicated that 96% have some form of implicit-bias-oriented diversity training program (CBS News, 2019). Despite these widespread efforts, most bias-training programs have not been evaluated empirically and are not informed by psychological research on bias reduction or lasting behavior change ( James, 2017;Paluck et al., 2021). The little research on the efficacy of modern diversity training programs has been almost exclusively conducted in non-law-enforcement settings and may not generalize to policing (",abstract,Abstract,0,NA,NA

The paper also discusses the theoretical rationale behind the assumption that stress influences voice features, and the potential for using wearable technologies and microphone sensors to gather this data.",7.28e-4,"The voice conveys rich information about the speaker. Voice features such as pitch and speech rate are associated with speakers' age (Ptacek & Sander, 1966), sex (Lass et al., 1980), emotional states (e.g., Scherer, 2003), and disorders (e.g., depression;Mundt et al., 2007). Particularly prevalent is the assumption that changes in voice features allow inferences about an individual's stress levels (Schuller, 2018;Slavich et al., 2019), thus providing a potentially objective measure of stress, stress being broadly defined as emotional, mental, and physiological strain in response to a real or perceived demand or threat (Goodday & Friend, 2019). Given the ubiquity of wearable technologies and microphone sensors in smartphones and smart speakers (e.g., Amazon's Echo), it could be possible to gather longitudinal voice data that provide insight on human stress levels (Goodday & Friend, 2019;Slavich et al., 2019). Considering that stress is a universal cause of health problems (Hassard et al., 2018), this could help to monitor the everyday impact of stressors and facilitate early stress detection, potentially contributing to better well-being (Slavich et al., 2019). The predominant theoretical rationale behind the assumption that stress influences voice features is that stress, resulting from stressors, impacts the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems and the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Giddens et al., 2013).",abstract,Abstract,0,NA,NA

The way they respond can predict important life outcomes many years later, including academic achievement and stress tolerance (Shoda et al., 1990). Previously, the standard interpretation was that children's waiting behavior is grounded in a stable capacity to sacrifice an immediate reward for a greater future benefit. However, in recent years there has been a shift toward interpreting it in terms of strategic control in the service of specific goals (Doebel, 2020). One reason for this shift is a growing body of evidence that children's responses are highly sensitive to manipulations of the social context (e.g., Doebel & Munakata, 2018;Kidd et al., 2013). The present research builds on this foundation by testing a stronger claim about the role of the social context: that the offer of a reward itself can serve as a social cue that influences children's behavior. Evidence that manipulating the social context can affect how young children respond to incentives for waiting has been diverse and robust. The manipulations have tended to involve introducing socially relevant information to a delay-of-gratification task.

Morally outrageous content often goes viral on social media (Brady et al., 2017), making users likely to encounter the same description of the same wrongdoing repeatedly. How might this repeated exposure affect moral judgments? Theoretically, repeated exposure could make a wrongdoing seem more unethical by increasing its salience (Mrkva & Van Boven, 2020) or by implying it is infamous ( Jacoby et al., 1989;Weaver et al., 2007). However, in laboratory experiments, repetition makes wrongdoings seem less unethical (Effron, 2022;Effron & Raj, 2020). This moral-repetition effect occurs because repeatedly reading about wrongdoings diminishes anger (an affective-desensitization mechanism; Dijksterhuis & Smith, 2002), and less anger means less severe moral judgments (Avramova & Inbar, 2013).

However, similar offenses often result in dissimilar professional outcomes (North et al., 2019). What might contribute to this variation? We propose that one factor is the perceived artistic-versus-scientific nature of the offender's professional work. Drawing on research in moral decoupling (Bhattacharjee et al., 2013), we theorize that work viewed as more art than science (vs. more science than art) is harder to mentally separate from the artist's (vs. the scientist's) personal moral character. As a result, this psychological process increases the professional (i.e., work-relevant) costs of misconduct for those perceived more as artists (vs. scientists). Surprisingly little research has examined how categorizing someone or something as ""artistic"" versus ""scientific"" affects judgments, even though these labels are prominently used and frequently contrasted in everyday experience.

Individuals hold bachelor of arts or bachelor of science degrees; governments allocate separate funding for arts and sciences; marketers frame products as more artistic or scientific (Philipp-Muller et al., 2023). Yet the implications of these categorizations for social judgment remain understudied. According to prior literature, when people, activities, works, and so on are categorized as artistic, it suggests that they involve emotion, imagination, intuition, or all three (Bullot & Reber, 2013). In contrast, when such objects are categorized as scientific, it suggests they involve cognitive, procedural, and systematic processes (Miceli et al., 2020).

Seemingly endless factors-cost, neighborhood, shops, proximity to family, new jobs, educational opportunities, et cetera-complicate the process (Kulu & Milewski, 2007). But for people in same-gender relationships, the process is even more complicated. Questions such as ""will our community accept and support us?"" become vitally important. But do systemic factors concerning sexuality relate to same-gender couples' residency location? Here, we consider how regional measures of bias relate to where same-gender couples live. We address two questions. First, what are some of the important predictors of regional measures of bias (explicit and implicit) against sexual minorities, and do these regional measures of bias relate to each other? Second, do these regional measures of bias predict where same-gender couples live? People can be biased toward groups at both the individual and community levels (Hehman et al., 2019;Murphy & Walton, 2013). Systemic bias exists where inequalities privilege people from some groups and disadvantage others (Murphy et al., 2018).

Much research has found that humor promotes important relationship outcomes and is highly desired by potential mates (Buss, 1988). However, although evolutionarily minded scholars have employed frameworks like sexual-selection theory (Bressler et al., 2006) and the interest-indicator model (Li et al., 2009) to understand the roots and function of humor, such perspectives have not been applied to studying the day-to-day unfolding of humor in relationship maintenance. Evolutionarily minded research on humor has primarily focused on its importance in mate choice and relationship initiation, with much evidence documenting the desirability of a humorous partner (e.g., Bressler et al., 2006). Accounts, however, differ on the role of humor in these contexts. One prominent perspective draws on sexual-selection theory (Darwin, 1871(Darwin, /1981)), proposing that the capacity for humor may indicate the presence of other fitness-enhancing traits, like creativity and intelligence (Miller, 2000). Furthermore, humor's role as a fitness indicator may be sex-differentiated. Given the greater obligatory reproductive costs borne by females, they have evolved to be choosier than males (Trivers, 1972).

These cognitive and affective-physiological symptoms are indicative of test anxiety (Cassady & Johnson, 2002;Pekrun, 2001). Test anxiety is defined as worries about possible negative consequences or failure in evaluative situations (Zeidner, 2007). Test-anxious students tend to react with anxiety in evaluative situations, which is why test anxiety is described as a situation-specific trait (Spielberger & Vagg, 1995). Approximately every third student reports some level of test anxiety (Quek et al., 2019). This finding suggests that test anxiety is widespread among students. Meta-analyses consistently show that test anxiety is negatively linked to academic achievement.

Prominent theories suggest that memories are constructed in order to facilitate navigating the present moment, often at the expense of recalling exact accounts of what happened (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000;Schacter et al., 2011). However, it is important that memories maintain some degree of accuracy so that we can learn from the past in meaningful ways (Conway & Loveday, 2015). If memories were too vulnerable to change, they would no longer provide us with useful information. To the extent that we rely on memories to be accurate in personal and societal (e.g., eyewitness testimony) realms, it is important to understand what factors impact an autobiographical memory's vulnerability to change. Autobiographical memory allows us to mentally travel to the past, evoking imagery, sensations, or emotions that can recreate the subjective experience of the original event (Rubin, 2006;Tulving, 1985).

It contributes to various aspects of human life, from mundane activities such as navigating in a complex urban environment or assembling an IKEA chair, all the way up to advanced technological feats such as charting the complex three-dimensional structures of protein molecules or designing new models of aircraft engine. During development, spatial abilities can predict school performance (Casey et al., 1995;Halpern et al., 2007) and are particularly associated with academic achievements and attainment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM; Newcombe & Frick, 2010;Wai et al., 2009). Consequently, improving spatial ability through training is of great significance. However, little is known about the developmental trajectory of spatial ability across the life span and, more importantly, the critical period for its training. For instance, at which stage of development will training on spatial ability be most effective? Will elementary school students benefit from repetitive training on spatial ability? Though there is consensus that infants in their first several months show evidence of rudimentary mental rotation and 3D perception ability (Christodoulou et al., 2016;Hespos & Rochat, 1997) and that spatial ability improves with age from childhood (Vander Heyden et al., 2016), our understanding of the development of spatial ability across the life span is not yet comprehensive. For example, the maturation of spatial ability from childhood to adulthood and its decline at older age have not been systematically measured and depicted. Filling this gap requires testing all age groups with the same task and collecting a sufficiently large number of participants at each developmental stage. More importantly, it is critical to know not only how spatial ability changes with age but also when spatial ability is most sensitive to training during development 1137313P SSXXX10.",abstract,Abstract,0,NA,NA

However, the beneficial effects of social adversity are often ignored. In this study, we investigated whether and how social adversity affects learning and memory in a mouse social defeat stress (SDS) model. A total of 652 mice were placed in experimental groups of six to 23 mice each. SDS enhanced spatial, novelty, and fear memory with increased synaptosome associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) level and dendritic spine density in hippocampal neurons among young but not middle-aged mice. Chemogenetic inhibition of hippocampal CaMK2A+ neurons blocked SDSinduced enhancement of learning or memory. Knockdown of SNAP-25 or blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit GluN2B in the hippocampus prevented SDS-induced learning memory enhancement in an emotionindependent manner. These findings suggest that social adversity promotes learning and memory ability in youths and provide a neurobiological foundation for biopsychological antifragility.",abstract,Abstract,0,NA,NA
yu-et-al-2022-neural-and-cognitive-signatures-of-guilt-predict-hypocritical-blame.pdf.tei.xml,The main claim of this paper is that hypocritical blame is morally wrong because hypocrites do not really care about the transgressions they are blaming others for.,4.62e-4,"One form of hypocrisy involves double standards or discrepancies between judgments of oneself and others, such as claiming that certain actions are forbidden for others but permissible for oneself (Graham et al., 2015;Valdesolo & DeSteno, 2007). Another involves discrepancies between moral judgments and behaviors, such as ""saying one thing and doing another"" (Dover, 2019;Howe & Monin, 2017;Laurent & Clark, 2019). A paradigmatic example of the latter is hypocritical blame, where someone blames others for transgressions that they themselves previously committed (Tognazzini & Coates, 2018). Consider politicians who have extramarital affairs while condemning adultery in other people or environmental activists who jet to exotic destinations but vociferously shame others for flying. Philosophers argue that hypocritical blame is morally wrong because hypocrites do not really care about the 1122765P SSXXX10.",abstract,Abstract,0,NA,NA
yu-et-al-2023-gaze-triggered-communicative-intention-compresses-perceived-temporal-duration.pdf.tei.xml,"The main claim of this paper is that the processing of intention triggered by gaze plays a key role in modulating time perception, and that there is a special mechanism tuned to social cues which can shape our perception of the outer world in time domains.",4.73e-4,"Eye gaze communicates a person's attentional state and intentions toward objects. Here we demonstrate that this important social signal has the potential to distort time perception of gazed-at objects (N = 70 adults). By using a novel gaze-associated learning paradigm combined with the time-discrimination task, we showed that objects previously associated with others' eye gaze were perceived as significantly shorter in duration than the nonassociated counterparts. The time-compression effect cannot be attributed to general attention allocation because it disappeared when objects were associated with nonsocial attention cues (i.e., arrows). Critically, this effect correlated with observers' autistic traits and vanished when the gazing agent's line of sight was blocked by barriers, reflecting the key role of intention processing triggered by gaze in modulating time perception. Our findings support the existence of a special mechanism tuned to social cues, which can shape our perception of the outer world in time domains.",abstract,Abstract,0,NA,NA

The paper also suggests that the facets of narcissism have distinct hormonal underpinnings.",4.77e-4,"Grandiose narcissism is defined as increased motivation for status and viewing oneself as entitled and superior to others. We hypothesized that these tendencies might be associated with basal levels of testosterone because testosterone is considered the most social hormone-driving dominance and the motivation to achieve social status. We distinguished between two facets of grandiose narcissism: agentic (i.e., the tendency to self-promotion in order to win others' admiration and social influence) and antagonistic (i.e., a reactive strategy used to restore threatened status). In 283 adult men, we examined the association between these facets of narcissism and blood-tested and selfreported testosterone levels. Agentic narcissism-the default narcissistic strategy-was positively associated with both testosterone indicators. Moreover, self-reported and objectively measured testosterone were positively correlated. These findings extend previous work by showing that the facets of narcissism have distinct hormonal underpinnings.",abstract,Abstract,0,NA,NA

This is due to a miscalibration of expectations about others' prosocial motivation, which can create a barrier to asking for help when needed. The paper suggests that people may be overly reluctant to ask for help because of these miscalibrated expectations.",5.7e-4,"Performing acts of kindness increases well-being, yet people can be reluctant to ask for help that would enable others' kindness. We suggest that people may be overly reluctant because of miscalibrated expectations about others' prosocial motivation, underestimating how positively others will feel when asked for help. A pretest identified that interest in asking for help was correlated with expectations of how helpers would think and feel, but a series of scenarios, recalled experiences, and live interactions among adult participants in the United States (total N = 2,118) indicated that those needing help consistently underestimated others' willingness to help, underestimated how positively helpers would feel, and overestimated how inconvenienced helpers would feel. These miscalibrated expectations stemmed from underestimating helpers' prosocial motivation while overestimating compliance motivation. This research highlights a limitation of construing help-seeking through a lens of compliance by scholars and laypeople alike. Undervaluing prosociality could create a misplaced barrier to asking for help when needed.",abstract,Abstract,0,NA,NA

Previous research shows that preschoolers understand metaphors, but less is known about whether preschoolers can learn from metaphors. The current preregistered experiment investigated whether adults (n = 64) and 3-and 4-year-olds (n = 128) can use metaphors to make new inferences. In a betweensubjects design, participants heard information about novel artifacts, conveyed through either only positive metaphors (e.g., ""Daxes are suns"") or positive and negative metaphors (e.g., ""Daxes are suns. Daxes are not clouds.""). In both conditions, participants of all ages successfully formed metaphor-consistent inferences about abstract, functional features of the artifacts (e.g., that daxes light up rather than let out water). Moreover, participants frequently provided explanations appealing to the metaphors when justifying their responses. Consequently, metaphors may be a powerful learning mechanism from early childhood onward.",abstract,Abstract,0,NA,NA
ziano-koc-2023-prototypes-of-people-with-depression.pdf.tei.xml,"The main claim of this paper is that people hold specific prototypes and negative attitudes towards certain categories of people, such as those with depression, veterans, medical doctors, and nonprofit organization employees, which can have consequences in terms of how they are treated and perceived. The paper also suggests that these prototypes can influence recommendations for treatment and job placement, and explores ways to reduce people's reliance on these prototypes.",7.71e-4,"More than 264 million people are estimated to suffer from major depressive disorder (MDD;James et al., 2018), and depression is projected to be the leading cause of global disease burden by 2030 (World Health Assembly, 2013). Although there are effective treatments for depression (Muñoz et al., 2010), many people with depression remain undiagnosed or untreated (Wang et al., 2007). Laypeople hold various negative attitudes about people with depression (Angermeyer & Matschinger, 2003), and in turn they fail to properly recognize people with depression ( Jorm et al., 2005), resulting in underdiagnoses by mental health professionals (Sheehan, 2004;Williams et al., 2017). In this article, we first elicited laypeople's multifaceted prototypes of people with depression, including physical, psychological, and social features. Next, we examined whether a person who does not fit the person-with-depression prototype is less likely to be considered to have depression, feel psychological pain, and be recommended psychological treatment even when showing the clinical symptoms of depression. Further, we explored ways to reduce people's reliance on prototypes. People have very specific notions about how certain categories of people are and should be. These prototypes have consequences. People believe that veterans are more hands-on and less emotionally competent than nonveterans, and therefore recruiters recommend them to hands-on jobs (Shepherd et al., 2019). Nonprofit organizations' employees are considered to be more moral than for-profit organizations' employees and are therefore punished more harshly after a moral violation (Stiegert et al., 2021). Medical doctors are considered less able to feel negative feelings than the average worker, and therefore people believe that doctors are better able than most to ignore physical and mental issues (Goranson et al., 2020). Clinical psychologists and opinion researchers have long been interested in what the public thinks about 1204035P SSXXX10.1177/09567976231204035Ziano, KocPsychological Science research-article2023",abstract,Abstract,0,NA,NA
