(2014), who used identical procedures, materials, and dependent measures.","Power analysis and sample size.","Stimulus sample size was determined via power analysis of the sole existing similar study, which used neural activity to predict Internet downloads of music (Berns &amp; Moore, 2012).","An a priori power analysis showed that 40 participants per condition should have 80% power to detect an effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.63.","Sample size was determined using a power analysis (G*Power Version 3.1.9.2; Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007) based on previous studies that have investigated the link between decision outcomes and self-reported feelings using within-subjects designs.","A power analysis was mentioned by 93 (47%) of the respondents (although 20 of these respondents, or 22%, also mentioned practical constraints, such as available time and money).","We did not conduct a formal power analysis because we considered this sample sufficiently large for the purposes of estimation.","Finally, we asked them to indicate how often they conducted a power analysis (7-point Likert scale), to assess their own statistical knowledge (10-point scale), and to indicate their main subfield of psychological research.","Almost half of the respondents in the researcher condition in Study 1 indicated that they generally used a power analysis to determine their sample size (although they might not conduct a power analysis for every single study).","When asked about how they normally determined sample sizes in their own studies, more than half of our respondents indicated that they did not use a power analysis, which may explain why such analyses are presented in fewer than 3% of psychological articles (Bakker &amp; Wicherts, 2011).","Much research in psychology appears to be planned without formal power analysis, and many researchers appear to use rather intuitive approaches in determining their sample sizes.","First, researchers should always conduct a formal power analysis when planning a study (preferably, such an analysis would be part of an institutional review board's approval or part of preregistration of the study), and they should report this power analysis in their manuscript, together with a description of their sample.","Third, reviewers should check whether indeed a formal power analysis has been conducted (Asendorpf et al., 2013) and whether it is sound.","An initial power analysis suggested that a sample size between 30 and 46 observers would achieve the desired effect size (Cohen's f = 0.20-0.25, α = .05, β = 0.90).","Power analysis for RSA is not straightforward.","We based our power analysis on previous research on the optimistic learning bias (Garrett &amp; Sharot, 2014;Garrett et al., 2014;Korn et al., 2014;Kuzmanovic et al., 2015;Moutsiana et al., 2013;Sharot, Guitart-Masip, et al., 2012;Sharot, Kanai, et al., 2012;Sharot et al., 2011) Time Fig.","Once results were obtained, a power analysis (paired-samples t test, Cohen's d = 0.6, α = .05, one-tailed) indicated a minimum of 19 participants to reach a power of .8 (the effect size from Experiment 1 was computed as if reflecting a between-participants design, and thus, this power analysis revealed itself to be conservative).","On the basis of a power analysis in G*Power 3 (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007), we estimated that a sample size of 24 would be needed to provide 80% statistical power to achieve a medium effect size (d = 0.6) on binary choices using a one-sample t test against a 50% chance level and an alpha of .05.","Target sample size was determined in the same way as for Experiment 1, by conducting a power analysis in G*Power 3 (Faul et al., 2007).","This effect was replicated in Experiments 2 and 3, following a power analysis based on the data of Experiment 1.","For Experiment 2, the sample size was determined through a power analysis based on the data of Experiment 1.","On the basis of the same power analysis, we continued data acquisition for Experiment 3 until 25 participants met our inclusion criteria (3 participants were replaced).","We conducted sensitivity analyses using the Power Analysis for General ANOVA Designs program for the R Shiny app (Westfall, 2016), which suggested that roughly 130 participants would provide at least 80% statistical power to detect the hypothesized effect.","To determine our sample size for Experiment 1, we conducted an a priori power analysis with G*Power (Version 3.0; Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007).","Our sample size was based on those used in previous research (Cartei et al., 2012;Cartei et al., 2019), and a power analysis in G*Power (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007) confirmed that our sample size (N = 82) would allow us to detect an effect as small as 0.15 with a power of .80, which was smaller than most effects reported in this article.","This differs from the power-analysis calculation in our preregistration, in which we incorrectly stated that the power analysis suggested a total sample size of 280.","Because it was not possible to rely on prior research to determine the required sample size, we conducted a power analysis (using G*Power Version 3; Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007) with power set at .80, a relatively conservative alpha of .01, and an intermediate effect size (f ) of .25.","On the basis of an a priori power analysis (G*Power) using the reported effect size from Experiment 1, we estimated that a required sample size of 18 participants would be necessary to achieve an effect size (f ) of .35 (power = .80, α = .01).","Based on the reported effect size from Experiment 3, an a priori power analysis (G*Power) estimated that a sample size of 18 participants would be necessary to achieve an effect size (f ) of .35 (power = .80, α = .01).","The power analysis indicated that a sample of 96 would be sufficient to detect a medium-size effect (f = .20) in a mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a power of .90.","A power analysis with this correlation, an α of .05 (one-tailed), and power equal to 80% indicated that we needed to recruit 205 participants.","A power analysis based on this effect size, an α of .05 (one-tailed), and power equal to 90%, indicated that we needed to recruit 266 participants.","Instead, we conducted an a priori power analysis based on the comparison between the boost+ and consensus-only conditions of Experiment 2 (see the Supplemental Material; final N = 854, 65.81% female, mean age = 35.90 years, SD = 12.92).","Ninety subjects participated in three experiments for payment or course credit: 20 participants in Experiment 1 (14 female; age: M = 24.35 years, SD = 3.88; all right handed; sample size in this more exploratory experiment was chosen on the basis of a common practice for exploratory experiments in our laboratory), 20 participants in Experiment 2 (13 female; age: M = 23.35 years, SD = 1.77; all right handed; sample size was selected on the basis of a power analysis on the effect from Experiment 1; see preregistration at [https://osf .io/wa8g6/](https://osf.io/wa8g6/)), and 50 participants in Experiment 3 (29 female; age: M = 24.76 years, SD = 3.48; 47 right handed; sample size was defined by multiplying the sample size of Experiment 2 by 2.5; see Simonsohn, 2015).","This test was chosen for the power analysis because it directly assessed the central hypothesis, namely, that beliefs about oneself (in this case, beliefs about one's personality traits) would be related to corresponding visual features of the self-portrait.","This test was chosen for the power analysis because it directly assessed the central hypothesis, namely, that attitudes toward oneself (body self-esteem, in this case) would be related to visual features of the body self-portrait.","The full preregistered power analysis for this replication can be found on OSF at [https://osf.io/rkfq5/](https://osf.io/rkfq5/).","An a priori power analysis indicated that our experimental design required 54 participants to uncover an effect size (f) of .25 (similar to the effect size found by Xiao et al., 2015, who showed developmental changes in eye tracking of dynamic faces across infancy) in a 2 (within subjects) × 2 (between subjects) analysis of variance (ANOVA) given an α of .05 and 95% power (correlation among repeated measures = .5, no nonsphericity correction).","Our final sample size (N = 88), after we excluded data from participants as described above, exceeded the sample size required as indicated by the a priori power analysis.","Power analysis suggests that a 95% probability of detecting an effect of this size (Cohen's d = 0.20) requires a sample size of 327 in a within-subjects design.","Power analysis suggested that 45 participants were needed for a 95% chance of detecting an effect of this size.","Experiment 3 (N = 50), the number of participants was determined through power analysis based on our effect sizes in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively (we used higher power in Experiment 3, as this included a few changes to the design; see the Method section for Experiment 3).","This sample size was selected on the basis of an a priori power analysis that tested the difference between confidence resolution in Session 1 and Session 2 of Experiment 1 (using a two-tailed paired-samples t test with an α of .01).","The sample size was selected on the basis of a power analysis for the confidence-resolution effect in Experiment 2, which showed that 50 participants were required to achieve a power of .90 for an α of .05.","The sample size for the study was determined on the basis of an a priori power analysis (G*Power, Version 3.1; Faul et al., 2009) run for a mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) containing within-between interactions (two measurements and four groups, respectively).","A power analysis (conducted in G*Power Version 3.1; Faul et al., 2007) determined that at least 15 samples would be necessary to detect such an effect with a statistical power of .8.","A power analysis (conducted in G*Power Version 3.1; Faul et al., 2007) determined that 22 samples were necessary to detect such an effect with a statistical power of .9.","A power analysis based on the effect size obtained in Experiment 2 (r &lt; -.32 between WM precision and the bias magnitude) determined that at least 99 samples would be necessary to detect such an effect with a statistical power of .9.","To do so, we conducted a power analysis for a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) using G*Power (Version 3.1;Faul et al., 2007), which determined that a sample of 29 participants would be needed to detect an effect size (η p 2 ) of .42 with power of .95 and α of .05.","Thus, our results highlight the myriad effects of emotion on memory. conducted a power analysis based on Madan et al.'s (2017) second experiment.","Prior to the experiment, we conducted a power analysis based on the null hypothesis for the mean ordinal number in the revealed block (for more details regarding the analysis, see below).","This power analysis indicated that to obtain a power of at least .8 for detecting a medium effect size (d = 0.5), approximately 32 participants were needed (for more information, see the preregistrations).","A power analysis using G*Power (Version 3.1.9.3;Faul et al., 2007) indicated that this required a sample size of 34.","An a priori power analysis revealed that we required 400 participants to detect effect sizes of minimal interest for all of our hypotheses (for details about the power analysis, see [https://osf.io/fx4rh/](https://osf.io/fx4rh/)).","Because no prior research has directly addressed the question at hand, we did not have an a priori estimate of the effect size of the crucial time-bycomplexity interaction for a formal power analysis.","Sample size was determined prior to data collection on the basis of the results of a power analysis using the data from Experiment 1, and it was preregistered on OSF ([https://osf.io/anxvd](https://osf.io/anxvd)).","Because our original power analysis suggested that even with 45 participants we were well powered to detect our effect of interest (namely, the Real-Time Entropy × Trial interaction), we chose to analyze the data at that point rather than collect the last three participants' data.","A post hoc power analysis revealed that a sample size of 309 was sufficient to detect a correlation (r = .24) between test anxiety and academic achievement with high statistical power (b = 0.99).","These findings demonstrate that what we hear has profound impacts on how we perceive the visual world. performed a power analysis on the data obtained from Experiment 1a and found that we could adequately detect effects of sound on report error as low as Cohen's d z = 0.45 with a sample size of 40 (power of .8 and an α of .05; using the base R package pwr; Champley et al., 2018).","The effect size obtained in Study 1 (η p 2 = .093) suggested that at least 27 participants were needed to obtain a power of 95% (power analysis run in G*Power Version 3.1; Faul et al., 2007).","We required 159 participants on the basis of a power analysis conducted using G*Power (Faul et al., 2009) to detect a medium effect (Cohen's f = .25) in a between-subjects one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with three levels.","A power analysis conducted using G*Power (Faul et al., 2009) indicated that 140 participants would be required to detect the expected two-way interaction with 80% power for a factorial ANOVA with four groups and four measurements on the repeated factor.","When we had no basis for estimating an effect size for the power analysis (Experiments 1a, 5, and 6) or when a pilot study indicated a small effect size (Experiment 3 and 7), we assumed a small effect (ϕ) of .10 (Cohen, 1988).","The sample size was determined through a power analysis based on the data of a pilot experiment (reported in the Supplemental Material).","We tested 38 participants (25 females, two other; age: M = 28 years, SD = 5) to arrive at the desired sample size of 35 (based on a power analysis; see Method of Experiments 2 and 3).","Power analysis","A power analysis was performed using G*Power (Faul et al., 2007) to estimate the sample size necessary to generate a medium-size effect of 0.25 with power of .95 for six measurements: time projection (past, future) × type of stimulation (sham, beta, alpha).","A power analysis demonstrated that 158 participants were needed to detect a small effect size (odds ratio = 1.5) in a two-tailed negative binomial regression (α = .05, β = 0.80).","A power analysis (calculated using the pwr package in the R programming environment; Version 3.6.1.","We chose to collect 80 data sets for each experiment after replacement of outliers (see below) on the basis of an a priori power analysis (α = .05, power = .85) using G*Power (Version 3.1;Faul et al., 2007), which yielded a projected sample size of 76 for the simplest within-group comparison in a study with a small to medium effect size (d = 0.35).","The semPower R package (Moshagen &amp; Erdfelder, 2016) was employed for power analysis.","Power analysis.","A post hoc power analysis was run.","The target sample of our power analysis (at least 133 participants who disbelieved the official version of events) was reached for seven out of eight topics.","On the basis of the same power analysis as in Study 1, we solicited 805 U.S. participants through Note: All conspiracy beliefs were measured on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree).","We note that for four of the topics (climate change, Hitler's suicide, the killing of bin Laden, and the death of Elvis Presley), the number of participants who disbelieved the official story was below the required number according to our power analysis (n = 133); we will revisit this issue in the General Discussion.","On the basis of the same power analysis as in Studies 1 and 3, we recruited 801 U.S. participants through Prolific.","For two of the topics (climate change and the killing of bin Laden), the number of participants who disbelieved the official story was below the required number according to our power analysis.","Our power analysis indicated that we would require 191 participants to detect an effect of small to medium size ( J.","Given that Studies 4a and 4b revealed a smaller effect size than Study 3, we performed a new power analysis in G*Power (Faul et al., 2009), averaging the effect sizes from Studies 3, 4a, and 4b, which indicated that a two-condition study required 779 participants for 80% power.","We used the same power analysis as in Study 5a.","Fifteen healthy infants between 184 and 261 days old (M = 220.40 days, SD = 20.17; four females; for the power analysis, see the Supplemental Material) with normal vision and hearing participated in Experiment 1a.","We decided to use the same sample size as in Experiment 1 (for the related power analysis, see the Supplemental Material).","We decided to use the same sample size as in Experiment 1 (for the related power analysis, see the Supplemental Material).","Our sample size was determined on the basis of the resources available to fund the $10,000 gifts; a post hoc power analysis for a one-sample t-test with a sample size of 199 and an α of .05 revealed that we had 80% power to detect an effect of at least d = 0.2.","An a priori power analysis using effect sizes from a previous investigation (He &amp; Côté, 2019) and an alpha level of .05 revealed that a sample size of 1,099 would provide .80 power to test the hypotheses.","The power analysis revealed a large sample-size requirement because of the small effect sizes detected in previous studies and the type of analyses that we conducted.","Details of the power analysis, including calculations of effect sizes in past studies, appear in our online supplement.","To derive an initial estimate of this relationship, we conducted an initial study using a convenience sample of 33 German-speaking participants (29 female, four male; 30 right handed, three left handed) between the ages of 18 and 55 years (age: M = 28.9 years, SD = 7.3) who were recruited through a research participant database maintained by the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics and by advertisements on the institute website (see the Data Analysis section for post hoc power analysis).","A post hoc power analysis using G*Power (Version 3.1; Faul et al., 2009) indicated that a sample of 32 participants rating 148 images (total of 4,736 measurements), modeled using random predictors for participant intercepts, participant slopes, and item intercepts (213 total predictors), resulted in a power (β) of 0.89 to detect an overall R 2 of .0625 (e.g., correlation of r = .25, corresponding to ρ 2 0193 = .","We conducted a power analysis using G*Power (Version 3.1; Faul et al., 2009) for a two-tailed paired-samples t test (power β = 0.8, α = .05) of the self-relevant versus otherrelevant conditions.","Basis for the power analysis of the predicted interaction of conditions (control, friendly climate, oppositional climate) and conflict in Study 3 was a mixed-model simulation with data from Study 2.","The sample size was determined on the basis of a power analysis that indicated 90 participants would be sufficient to achieve 80% power and a medium effect size.","To estimate the required sample size, we ran a power analysis using the simr package in R (Green &amp; MacLeod, 2016).","Therefore, we ran the power analysis using 10 time points per participant.","Our analysis indicated that 400 participants would be sufficient to detect such an effect with 99.10% power, 95% CI = [98.30, 99.59] (see the Supplemental Material for additional details on the power analysis).","G*Power was used for the a priori power analysis (Faul et al., 2007).","We used the same stopping rule as in Experiment 1a; we did not carry out a separate G*Power analysis for this experiment but rather used the same power calculation as in Experiment 1a to determine our sample size.","This threshold was set on the basis of a pilot experiment that revealed a small interaction ( f 2 = 0.06, 95% confidence interval, or CI = [0.02, 0.12]) and a subsequent power analysis that suggested that at least 47 participants per cell would be required to detect it.","A post hoc power analysis confirmed that we had a power of 0.84 to detect a medium effect.","We did not conduct an a priori power analysis.","Our power analysis indicated that a sample of 42 participants per age group would provide 80% power to detect differences in group means (α = .05).","This power analysis indicated that a sample size of 60 participants per age group would allow for at least 80% power to detect group differences at the standard alpha error probability of .05; however, we did not reach our full child-sample goal because of COVID-19.","The sample size for Experiment 2 was selected according to a simulation-based bootstrap power analysis so as to give in excess of 95% power to detect a betweenparticipants effect size estimated from permuted data from Experiment 1 (estimated between-participants Cohen's d = 0.63)."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>id<\/th>\n      <th>text<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":5,"dom":"tip","columnDefs":[{"name":"id","targets":0},{"name":"text","targets":1}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[5,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script><p>We caught a lot of sentences with that term, but are probably missing

is possible that less-consistent effects were observed on trials with errors because of reduced power to detect an effect on these trials, which by design were less numerous (~25%).","Figure 1 shows that CY had very little predictive power for CLIM, but the fit in the transposed plot has an obvious bell-shaped curve.","The present findings demonstrate the long-range power of self-control in predicting success in life and single out self-control as a key target for early intervention programs.","The cue objects resembled objects embedded in the aversive target scenes, thus serving as powerful triggers to remembering the scenes themselves.","We aimed to use this novel paradigm to investigate how well trauma-exposed individuals, with and without PTSD, could suppress retrieval of aversive images when triggered by powerful reminders.","We hypothesized that individuals with PTSD, compared with trauma-exposed individuals who have never developed PTSD, are less able to suppress retrieval of aversive scenes when confronted with powerful reminders.","Sample size was calculated with an a priori power analysis, using the effect sizes reported by Küpper et al. (2014), who used identical procedures, materials, and dependent measures.","We determined that a minimum sample size of 7 per group would be necessary for 95% power to detect an effect.","For the first part of the task, 11 static visual images, one from each of the scenes in the film were presented once each on a black background for 2 s using Power-Point.","A sample size of 26 per group was required to ensure 80% power to detect this difference at the 5% significance level.","A sample size of 18 per condition was required in order to ensure an 80% power to detect this difference at the 5% significance level.","The 13,500 selected loan requests conservatively achieved a power of .98 for an effect size of .07 at an alpha level of .05.","Power analysis and sample size.","On the basis of simulations over a range of expected effect sizes for contrasts of fMRI activity, we estimated that a sample size of 24 would provide .80 power at a conservative brainwide alpha threshold of .002 (although such thresholds ideally should be relaxed for detecting activity in regions where an effect is predicted).","This required a second power estimate.","Stimulus sample size was determined via power analysis of the sole existing similar study, which used neural activity to predict Internet downloads of music (Berns &amp; Moore, 2012).","The effect size from that study implied that a sample size of 72 loan requests would be required to achieve .80 power at an alpha level of .05.","Categorical ratings of the emotional expressions in the loan photographs had a similarly powerful impact on loan-request success; requests with \"happy\" photographs received $5.15 more per hour than requests with \"sad\" photographs, on average; they achieved full funding in 7.6% less time.","Thus, simple modifications of subjective features of loan requests (e.g., facial expressions) may have a surprisingly powerful impact on the requests' success, and indeed may have a greater impact than more traditional but costly changes in objective features (e.g., requested amount).","Although previous research has provided mixed evidence about the impact of positive versus negative affect on charitable giving (Andreoni, 1990;Small &amp; Verrochi, 2009), by simultaneously assessing affect at both Internet-aggregate and laboratory-sample levels of analysis, our studies provide consistent evidence that photograph-elicited positive arousal most powerfully promoted lending rates and outcomes (Tables 1 and2, Fig. 2a, and Fig.","Together, these findings from groups of typically developing children highlight the important contribution of oral language skills to reading development, though only the study of Christopher et al. (2015) included measures of rapid automatized naming (RAN), which is known to be a powerful predictor of the development of word-reading skills (Caravolas, Lervåg, Defior, Seidlová Málková, &amp; Hulme, 2013;Caravolas et al., 2012;Lervåg et al., 2009).","However, the findings provide powerful society-level evidence that is in line with past experimental or opportunity sample research showing that, after contextual threats, liberals shift toward conservative positions (e.g., Nail et al., 2009;van der Toorn et al., 2014).","An a priori power analysis showed that 40 participants per condition should have 80% power to detect an effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.63.","This sample size yielded greater than 80% power to detect group differences of the size we had previously observed in studies of awareness in eyeblink conditioning (e.g., Lovibond et al., 2011).","Furthermore, the effect of go and no-go runs is expected to be much smaller in the unpredictable condition, so much larger sample sizes would be needed to obtain sufficient statistical power in this condition.","Sample size was determined using a power analysis (G*Power Version 3.1.9.2; Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007) based on previous studies that have investigated the link between decision outcomes and self-reported feelings using within-subjects designs.","We determined that a sample size of 59 participants would achieve 85% power to detect an effect size of 0.401 with an alpha of .05.","This approach integrates insights from ultimate (evolutionary) and proximate (decision-making) levels of analysis and, in doing so, provides evidence for a powerful process underlying diverse forms of decision making.","Many psychology studies are statistically underpowered.","In Study 1, we surveyed 291 published research psychologists and found large discrepancies between their reports of their preferred amount of power and the actual power of their studies (calculated from their reported typical cell size, typical effect size, and acceptable alpha).","Furthermore, in Study 2, 89% of the 214 respondents overestimated the power of specific research designs with a small expected effect size, and 95% underestimated the sample size needed to obtain .80 power for detecting a small effect.","Neither researchers' experience nor their knowledge predicted the bias in their self-reported power intuitions.","Because many respondents reported that they based their sample sizes on rules of thumb or common practice in the field, we recommend that researchers conduct and report formal power analyses for their studies.","Reducing the possibility of Type II errors is another important consideration in improving the quality of studies, however: Studies should be well powered (Fiedler, Kutzner, &amp; Krueger, 2012;Simmons et al., 2011).","It has long been argued that researchers should conduct formal power analyses before starting data collection (Cohen, 1965(Cohen,, 1990), yet it continues to be the case that many studies in the psychological literature are statistically underpowered (Bakker et al., 2012;Cohen, 1990;Maxwell, 2004).","Specifically, given the typical effect sizes (ESs) and sample sizes reported in the psychological literature, the statistical power of a typical two-group between-subjects design has been estimated to be less than .50 (Cohen, 1990) or even .35 (Bakker et al., 2012).","These low power estimates appear to contradict the finding that more than 90% of published studies in the literature have p values below the typical threshold for significance (i.e., α = .05; Fanelli, 2010;Sterling, Rosenbaum, &amp; Weinkam, 1995).","Despite the centrality of power in NHST ( Gigerenzer, 2004), formal power analyses are rarely reported in the literature.","Sedlmeier and Gigerenzer (1989) found that none of the 54 articles published in the 1984 volume of the Journal of Abnormal Psychology reported the power of the statistical tests that were presented.","In a more recent and fairly representative sample of 271 psychological articles that involved the use of NHST (Bakker &amp; Wicherts, 2011), only 3% of the authors explicitly discussed power as a consideration in designing their studies.","Thus, it appears that sample-size decisions are hardly ever based on formal and explicitly reported (a priori) power considerations.","Here, we consider another explanation of the common failure to conduct sufficiently powerful studies, namely, researchers' intuitions about statistical power.","In addition, when Greenwald (1975) asked social psychologists what the acceptable Type II error rate was, the average response was around .27, which means that an acceptable level of power would be .73, which again is markedly higher than the overall power estimates for published studies, as reported by Cohen (1990) and Bakker et al.","These results suggest that researchers may intuitively overestimate the power associated with their own research and that of others (i.e., in their role as reviewers).","Given the centrality of power in the debate regarding reproducibility and replicability of research in psychology and beyond (e.g., Asendorpf et al., 2013;Button et al., 2013;Gilbert, King, Pettigrew, &amp; Wilson, 2016;Open Science Collaboration, 2015), we surveyed psychology researchers on their practices, intuitions, and goals related to statistical power.","In our first study, respondents assumed the role of either researcher (reporting on their own studies) or reviewer (assessing their peers' studies) in answering questions about typical and acceptable cell sizes (ns), ESs, power levels, and alpha levels.","In our second study, respondents estimated the actual power of several research designs and the sample size that would be required to achieve a power of .80 in various research designs.","Specifically, here we discuss the respondents' descriptions of how they generally determined their sample size (researcher condition only, because answers to the corresponding question in the reviewer condition were hard to classify) and their assessments of the acceptable Type I error rate, the power level regarded as satisfactory, the cell size typically considered sufficient, and the typically expected ES (in Cohen's d ) for an independent-samples t test.","A power analysis was mentioned by 93 (47%) of the respondents (although 20 of these respondents, or 22%, also mentioned practical constraints, such as available time and money).","Furthermore, 45 respondents (23%) mentioned some rule of thumb (e.g., 20 subjects per condition), 41 respondents (21%) based sample sizes on the common practice in their field of research, and 18 respondents (9%) wanted as many subjects as possible, to have the highest possible power to detect an effect.","As the distributions were not normal and included outliers (histograms and medians are presented in the Supplemental Material), we report the trimmed means (M t s; 20% trimming) and used robust statistics to increase power and to protect against an incorrect estimation of the Type I error rate (Bakker &amp; Wicherts, 2014;Welch, 1938;Wilcox, 2012;Yuen, 1974).","The average reported acceptable levels for α and power were .05 and .80, respectively.","Responses to these questions, in particular, seemed to reflect a common standard, as 83% of our respondents reported that the acceptable α level is .05, and 69% reported that power of .80 is sufficient.","However, for an independent-samples t test with 20 to 25 subjects in each condition and d of 0.5 (medium ES), the actual power lies between .34 and .41, which is approximately half the power that the respondent mentioned.","Considering that 53% of the respondents in the researcher condition indicated that they did not generally conduct power analyses and 23% reported using some rule of thumb, we wondered whether respondents' intuitive power analyses were accurate.","To investigate this, we calculated the power of a study with α, ES, and cell size equal to the trimmed means obtained in Study 1, using the pwr package in R (Champely, 2009).","Such a study would have power of .35.","(When we calculated power separately for each respondent's reported values of α, ES, and n, we found that the trimmed mean power across respondents was .40.)","We also calculated the required cell size given the trimmed means for α, ES, and power, and found that it would be 105 subjects, which is 3 times as many subjects as respondents' trimmed mean for n.","A robust within-subjects Yuen t test (Wilcox, 2012;Yuen, 1974) indicated that respondents' reported acceptable power levels differed significantly from the calculated power based on their responses to the other questions, t(171) = 19.38, p &lt; .001, ξ = .82, 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference = [.36, .44].","We also calculated the bias for each respondent individually (calculated power -reported power).","The trimmed mean bias was -.34; 80% of the respondents showed a negative bias (calculated power lower than desired power), and 33% showed a negative bias with an absolute value larger than .5.","A majority of the respondents in Study 1 reported that power of .80 is satisfactory, and this is the common standard advised by Cohen (1965) and other researchers.","The goal of Study 2 was to measure researchers' power intuitions more directly, by asking them to estimate the power of research designs with α, ES, and N specified.","Additionally, we presented examples of research designs with α and ES specified, and asked respondents to estimate the number of subjects needed to reach a power of .80.","We did not conduct a formal power analysis because we considered this sample sufficiently large for the purposes of estimation.","The first 3 asked the respondents to estimate the power of independent-samples (two-tailed) t tests in three research situations, which differed in the ES (Cohen's d = 0.20, 0.50, or 0.80); α was set at .05 throughout.","In the next 3 questions, we asked the respondents to estimate the sample sizes required for an independent-samples t test to have a power of .80 given expected ESs (Cohen's d ) of 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80; each ES was accompanied by the corresponding correlation (.10, .24, or .37, respectively), and α was again set at .05.","Next, we tested respondents' understanding of what power is with a single multiple-choice question.","Finally, we asked them to indicate how often they conducted a power analysis (7-point Likert scale), to assess their own statistical knowledge (10-point scale), and to indicate their main subfield of psychological research.","Intuitions about power and sample size.","We calculated the true power of the research designs presented to the respondents using the pwr package in R (Champely, 2009); these values are presented in Table 1 and Figure 1, along with the 20% trimmed means and 95% CIs for the respondents' estimates.","Most respondents were not able to estimate the true power values well.","The true power lay within the 95% CI for only one scenario in the medium-N condition (when d = 0.50) and one scenario in the small-N condition (when d = 0.80).","The vast majority of respondents (89%) overestimated power for the small-ES scenario.","When the ES was large and N was greater than 80, respondents underestimated the power of the t test in the design we presented to them.","A comparable pattern was found when respondents estimated the sample sizes required to obtain a power of .80 in an independent-samples t test, given a specific expected ES.","Whereas respondents estimated, on average, that 216 subjects were needed, 788 subjects would actually be needed to obtain sufficient power in the case of such a small effect.","This might be a carryover effect from the questions asking respondents to estimate the power of research designs (e.g., effect of anchoring and adjustment; Epley &amp; Gilovich, 2006).","To explore possible influences on respondents' power intuitions, we looked at the data from both studies.","First, we found that respondents who reported doing power analyses to determine their sample sizes did not estimate power better than those who did not report conducting power analyses.","Almost half of the respondents in the researcher condition in Study 1 indicated that they generally used a power analysis to determine their sample size (although they might not conduct a power analysis for every single study).","The average calculated power for this group of respondents (M t = .46, 95% CI = [.37, .55]) was not significantly higher than that for the remaining respondents in the researcher condition (M t = .42, 95% CI = [.34, .51]).","Furthermore, the amount of bias did not differ significantly between respondents who mentioned typically doing power analyses (M t = -.31, 95% CI = [-.40, -.22]) and those who did not (M t = -.30, 95% CI = [-.39, -.22]).","Next, for Study 2, we used a principal components analysis to summarize respondents' answers to the questions regarding their understanding of what power means (question correctly answered by 168 respondents, or 78.5%), how often they conducted power analyses, and how good their statistical knowledge was.","The first component explained 50% of the variance, and we used hierarchical regression analyses to investigate whether scores on this component predicted estimates of power and required sample sizes.","The dependent variables were the power and sample-size estimates for each presented research design.","We did not find a significant effect of component score on power estimates for the small-ES scenario (b = -0.01, t = -0.98, p = .329).","However, when the ES was medium or large, respondents with higher component scores had higher (and hence more accurate) power estimates (b = 0.02, t = 2.26, p = .025, and b = 0.04, t = 3.94, p &lt; .001, respectively).","Furthermore, when the specified ES was large, respondents with higher component scores gave smaller estimates of the sample size required to achieve a power of .80 (b = -12.89, t = -2.56, p = .011), which again resulted in estimates closer to the true value.","In Study 1, respondents' self-reported statistical knowledge correlated with neither calculated power nor bias.","In addition, robust regression analyses revealed that number of publications did not significantly predict either calculated power or bias.","Finally, we did not find any significant differences between research fields in Study 1 respondents' calculated power (full results are presented in the Supplemental Material).","With a robust 3 (condition) × 9 (research field) two-way analysis of variance using the trimmed means, we tested for differences between research fields in power and sample-size estimates.","It has long been noted that the statistical power of studies in the psychological literature is typically too low ( Bakker et al., 2012;Cohen, 1990;Maxwell, 2004).","Specifically, for studies of effects expected to have the most typical magnitude, respondents overestimated power and consequently underestimated the required sample size.","When asked about how they normally determined sample sizes in their own studies, more than half of our respondents indicated that they did not use a power analysis, which may explain why such analyses are presented in fewer than 3% of psychological articles (Bakker &amp; Wicherts, 2011).","Much research in psychology appears to be planned without formal power analysis, and many researchers appear to use rather intuitive approaches in determining their sample sizes.","In our first study, the calculated power based on respondents' reported acceptable sample sizes and expected ESs was only half of the power respondents indicated they wanted to achieve.","The power intuitions of more than 75% of respondents resulted in calculated power that was lower than desired.","In our second study, 89% of respondents overestimated the power of studies with small expected ESs, and 95% underestimated the sample size required for sufficient power when the ES was small.","When the expected ES was small, the true sample size needed to reach a power of .80 was more than 3 times the respondents' mean estimate of the required sample size.","In combination with publication bias, the (strategic) use of small sample sizes and research designs that are underpowered results in inflated Type I error rates, biased ES estimates, distorted meta-analytical results, and nonreplicable findings (Bakker et al., 2012;Open Science Collaboration, 2015).","Even researchers who stated that they typically used formal power analyses had poor power intuitions.","In line with earlier work showing the same poor statistical intuitions among general and mathematical psychologists (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1971), our studies indicate that greater self-reported statistical knowledge and experience are not related to better power intuitions in the most common cases (when the ES is small).","Nevertheless, it is possible that some of our respondents were more familiar with other research designs that have different associations between sample size and power (e.g., within-subjects designs are typically more powerful).","However, if experience with research designs had influenced our results, power intuitions should have differed more between subfields that typically use different research designs.","Future research could focus on power intuitions related to other research designs, such as within-subjects and correlational designs.","However, the questions calling for power estimates and the questions calling for sample-size estimates showed the same pattern of results: large discrepancies between estimated and actual values in all conditions when the ES was small.","Furthermore, the response rate in both studies was quite low (26% and 13%, respectively), and researchers who are knowledgeable about power are probably overrepresented in this sample because of their interest in the subject.","Therefore, we expect that a more balanced sample would show even larger overestimation of power and underestimation of required sample sizes in research designs.","Poor intuitions about power may lead to incorrect inferences concerning nonsignificant results.","Researchers often conduct multiple small (and therefore likely underpowered) studies of the same underlying phenomenon (Francis, 2014;Hartgerink, Wicherts, &amp; van Assen, 2015).","Given the flawed power intuitions we observed, it is quite likely that researchers dismiss nonsignificant outcomes in such studies as due to methodological flaws (i.e., \"failed studies\") or feel inclined to interpret nonsignificant outcomes as reflecting a true null effect, although in fact these outcomes might be false negatives ( Hartgerink et al., 2015;Maxwell, Lau, &amp; Howard, 2015).","First, researchers should always conduct a formal power analysis when planning a study (preferably, such an analysis would be part of an institutional review board's approval or part of preregistration of the study), and they should report this power analysis in their manuscript, together with a description of their sample.","This will force researchers to explicate their samplesize decisions and will likely lead to better-powered studies.","Second, considering that often no appropriate ES estimation is available and that our results indicate that intuitions for exponential power functions are often suboptimal and potentially linear, we recommend that power analyses be accompanied by inspection of the implications of a range of ES estimates, especially at the lower end of this range.","This will help researchers understand the exponential relations involved in statistical power and the considerable impact of seemingly small changes in ES estimates (see also Perugini, Gallucci, &amp; Costantini, 2014).","Third, reviewers should check whether indeed a formal power analysis has been conducted (Asendorpf et al., 2013) and whether it is sound.","Fourth, confirmatory studies, or core studies in a research line, should be sufficiently powerful and preregistered (Asendorpf et al., 2013;Wagenmakers et al., 2012).","Both parties may misestimate the power of studies, regardless of their self-assessed statistical expertise.","There is really only one way to improve studies: power them up.","Linguistic body descriptors are compact but can operate as powerful perceptual discriminators.","Although it is the largest of its kind regarding both the number of twins in the sample and the number of assessments, our sample was relatively small compared with the samples in conventional twin studies, and our power to detect small effects was limited.","We chose three age groups for adolescents as a compromise between the increased sensitivity that comes with increasing numbers of groups and the loss of power this engenders.","We aimed to collect data from 200 participants, in order to have 80% power to detect an interaction effect corresponding to a Cohen's d of 0.40.","We aimed to collect data from 340 participants to have 80% power to detect a small to medium effect (i.e., the size of the effect found in Study 1).","Contingency is a powerful driver of motivation (see Deci, Koestner, &amp; Ryan, 1999, for a review), and at first glance, it might seem wasteful to improve performance when rewards do not depend on performance (Lepper &amp; Greene, 1978).","The sample size was based on our decision to recruit as many ASC participants as possible and then calculate the number of control participants necessary to provide approximately 70% power to detect a difference between groups given the difference in proportions of consistent choices observed between the low-and high-AQ groups in the AQ study, which was conducted first (higher power would require unfeasibly large numbers of control participants; Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, &amp; Lang, 2009).","The sample sizes were chosen to achieve more than 80% power to detect a medium-sized effect (d = 0.5) in simple between-groups comparisons (Faul et al., 2009).","These interventions harnessed both competitiveness and the power of social norms.","An initial power analysis suggested that a sample size between 30 and 46 observers would achieve the desired effect size (Cohen's f = 0.20-0.25, α = .05, β = 0.90).","Finally, in addition to conducting DNA analyses, we used twin data to obtain the first well-powered estimate of the degree to which intergenerational educational attainment is heritable.","This finding is in line with two prior studies on molecular genetic correlates of educational attainment that relied on a less powerful GPS: Conley et al. (2015) found evidence of genetic transmission in parent-child educational correlations, and Domingue et al. (2015) found that participants with higher polygenic scores were more likely to grow up in socially advantaged families.","This sample size has been shown to be sufficient to fit moderately complex structural equation models with adequate power (e.g., Wolf, Harrington, Clark, &amp; Miller, 2013).","This sample size has been shown to be sufficient to fit moderately complex structural equation models with adequate power (e.g., Wolf, Harrington, Clark, &amp; Miller, 2013).","Although signaling wealth through greater consumption acts as a way for poorer groups to restore feelings of self-integrity (Sivanathan &amp; Pettit, 2010) and personal power (Rucker &amp; Galinsky, 2008, 2009), conspicuous consumption can also perpetuate financial hardship because it limits self-investment (Moav &amp; Neeman, 2012).","These methods were used in the context of a larger study; sample size from that study was determined to be sufficient to detect the hypothesized associations between oxytocin and targets' perceptions if the effect were moderate in size, at 94% power, so all available urine samples were assayed.","Second, the fWHR literature consists of predominantly underpowered studies based on very small samples.","To date, however, fWHR research has not produced strong evidence for such links; male fWHR has been reported to correlate only weakly with some of the Psychopathic Personality Inventory-Revised scales (Anderl et al., 2016;Geniole et al., 2014) and with Anderson's Personal Sense of Power scale (Haselhuhn &amp; Wong, 2012).","Power analysis for RSA is not straightforward.","We used G*Power 3.1 (Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, &amp; Lang, 2009) to calculate desired sample sizes.","We based our power analysis on previous research on the optimistic learning bias (Garrett &amp;

therefore, we aimed to recruit 280 participants with a BDI score lower than 12 (see the preregistered material for further details).","To achieve a power of .90, we needed a sample of 67 participants, and for a medium correlation (r = .3) between learning bias and charity donation, we needed 80 participants per condition for a power of .80.","Power analyses, measures, conditions, and exclusions are reported in the Supplemental Material available online.","For example, we did not have enough statistical power to examine interactions between the polygenic score and SES, and we restricted our analyses to two broad indicators of antisocial behavior-criminal offending and life-course-persistent antisocial behavior-rather than zooming in on finer distinctions.","Instructed rules have powerful effects on behavior when they are implemented or maintained for future use (Meiran, Liefooghe, &amp; De Houwer, 2017).","To increase power and reduce the number of significance tests, we combined the data of the 4-and 5-, 6-and 7-, 8-and 9-, 10-and 11-, and 17-to 19-year-olds, resulting in five groups.","Furthermore, we propose that the next paradigm might be a useful tool to study structuring and implementation of instructions in different age groups and, more generally, the powerful effects that instructions and intentions can have on behavior.","First, sample sizes are usually small, meaning that studies are very underpowered (Gangestad et al., 2016).","There, the relationship-context effect was not significant, probably because these analyses were less powerful than our other analyses.","Note that women's masculinity preferences tended to be stronger when they were using the combined oral contraceptive pill (although not significantly so), suggesting that a lack of power did not prevent detection of the hypothesized weaker masculinity preferences when women are using the combined oral contraceptive pill.","Several studies across different cultures have found an association between a relatively tall stature and holding a position of power (Handwerker &amp; Crosbie, 1982;Werner, 1982).","In the dictator game, one player has unconditional power over resource allocation, while in the ultimatum game, that player's allocation decision can be rejected-thus posing a risk of retaliation by the opponent.","In Study 1, opponent height did not affect resource allocation in the dictator game, but having a taller opponent was related to taking more resources in the dictator game (allocator has unconditional power) compared with the ultimatum game (allocator has conditional power, opponent can retaliate).","The results imply that participant height is most important in predicting competitive behaviors in an absolute-power situation (the dictator game), regardless of opponent height.","However, it remains largely unclear why implicit partner evaluations have such a powerful predicting influence on long-term outcomes.","Consequently, we argue that positive implicit partner evaluations may be especially powerful predictors of positive relationships' long-term outcomes because they regularly promote more constructive nonverbal behavior in daily life.","In line with recent guidance (Finkel, Eastwick, &amp; Reis, 2015), as well as recruitment and financial constraints, the sample size was decided prior to data collection on the basis of the large sample sizes used in previous relationship studies (e.g., McNulty et al., 2013) and combined with a diary design to maximize statistical power.","Because one unique aspect of romantic dyads is that partners are very spontaneous toward each other (Collins &amp; Feeney, 2000), nonverbal behavior stands out as a powerful interpersonal process through which implicit partner evaluations exert their influences on relational outcomes over time.","Whereas the predictive power of self-report measures has been challenged ( Joel et al., 2017), the present multimethod approach provides new insights that may help relationship research move forward.","Once results were obtained, a power analysis (paired-samples t test, Cohen's d = 0.6, α = .05, one-tailed) indicated a minimum of 19 participants to reach a power of .8 (the effect size from Experiment 1 was computed as if reflecting a between-participants design, and thus, this power analysis revealed itself to be conservative).","There are at least two interpretations of these new results: One interpretation is that the original study lacked sufficient power to detect an interaction effect.","Indeed, the study had 46% power to detect a mediumsized effect (OR = 2 or Cohen's d = 0.30).","More generally, any factor affecting the distribution of p values and their frequency in the interval .05 to .10, such as the statistical power of research, p hacking, or merely the reporting of statistical results, will affect the percentage of articles reporting one or more results as marginally significant.","Using the same data set as Hartgerink (2016), we also extracted information on the degrees of freedom across disciplines for a supplementary analysis of statistical power in psychology articles.","Consecutively, this frequency of p values is affected by trends in the reporting of p values and trends in the statistical power of psychological research over time, although there is, at most, a small increase in power over time in our data (see the Supplemental Material).","Note that possible trends in p-value reporting and power do not affect the percentage of p values reported as marginally significant, as that percentage is conditional on the p value being between .05 and .10.","Psychological science can be a powerful tool for quantifying the association between screen use and adolescent well-being, yet it routinely fails to supply the robust, objective, and replicable evidence necessary to support its hypotheses.","This sample size was large enough for even small effects to be detected with 80% power (at α = .05).","Second, a simulation demonstrated that data sets of similar magnitude and distributional properties could have, in principle, favored alternative models with close to 100% power.","Simulating data in this manner also allowed us to ask about power and model selection: If we fitted both the g-factor latent change score model and the more complex mutualism model to data generated under the g-factor model, how often did we (rightly) prefer the g-factor model?","In 999 of 1,000 iterations, the g factor was preferred, suggesting 99.9% power to prefer the g-factor model if it was indeed the data-generating mechanism.","Finally, we investigated statistical power within the latent change score model; given our sample size and model specification, what is our statistical power to detect a reliable parameter estimate for the key (coupling) parameters?","With our current model specification and sample size, we had 73% power to detect a small coupling effect (r = .1, as defined by Gignac &amp; Szodorai, 2016) but effectively 100% power to detect intermediate (r = .2) and large (r = .3) effects.","Classical fear conditioning provides a powerful model to explain the acquisition of fear in humans and nonhuman animals (LeDoux, 2014) and is often used to explain the development of anxiety disorders (Lissek et al., 2005;Mineka &amp; Oehlberg, 2008).","Under the assumption of medium correlations between measurements (r = .3), an alpha error probability of .05, and a power of .8, we used G*Power (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007) to calculate that a total sample size of 37 would be required to achieve a medium effect size (η p 2 ) of .06 for betweenconditions differences.","On the basis of a power analysis in G*Power 3 (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007), we estimated that a sample size of 24 would be needed to provide 80% statistical power to achieve a medium effect size (d = 0.6) on binary choices using a one-sample t test against a 50% chance level and an alpha of .05.","Target sample size was determined in the same way as for Experiment 1, by conducting a power analysis in G*Power 3 (Faul et al., 2007).","It was estimated that a sample size of 24 would be needed to provide 80% statistical power.","We did not conduct formal power analyses prior to collecting data.","Such analyses are complex with multiple random effects because power varies with the number of stimuli, the number of participants, and the variance associated with each random effect (Westfall, Kenny, &amp; Judd, 2014).","With 30 stimuli, a medium effect size (d) of 0.50, and reasonable assumptions about variance-partitioning components, power of .80 could be achieved with 30 participants (Westfall et al., 2014).","With 30 stimuli and a sample size of 100, our studies would have a power of at least .80 to detect an effect (d) of approximately 0.40.","On the basis of the standard errors of the estimates, we also computed the approximate statistical power (1 -β) of these tests for a significance level (α) of 1% to allow evaluation of the conclusiveness of nonsignificant effects.","As an effect size under the alternative hypothesis, the median OR reported by Lu and colleagues (OR = 1.065) was used for the power calculations.","Strikingly, even though the power was above 96% for all 15 crime types, only the OR for antisocial behavior was significant (OR = 1.025, p = .005), which was the most prevalent type of crime in the data set and included offenses such as nuisance, inconsiderate neighbors, vandalism, street drinking, Note: Percentages in the left-hand column refer to the relative frequency of the crime category relative to the total number of crimes.","Moreover, the GAM used splines to model monthly seasonal trends and the geographic locations of districts, whereas the GLM assumed (discrete) fixed effects for months. b = estimate for the effect of the z-standardized pollution variable in a negative binomial regression; OR = odds ratio; 1 -β = approximate statistical power of the Wald test for a significance level (α) equal to 1% based on the median effect size reported by Lu, Lee, Gino, and Galinsky (2018; OR = 1.065); BF 01 = Bayes factor against the incremental effect of air pollution. littering, begging, or fireworks misuse.","Likewise, none of the frequentist Wald tests were significant at the nominal level (α) of 1% despite the high statistical power for all dependent variables (1 -β ≥ 93%).","That is, analyses of both Emotionality (p = .676) and its Anxiety facet (p = .652) clearly failed to reach statistical significance, whereas both tests had an approximate statistical power (1 -β) of 92% for detecting a small effect (i.e., an OR of 1.25 for a z-standardized predictor).","This effect was replicated in Experiments 2 and 3, following a power analysis based on the data of Experiment 1.","For Experiment 2, the sample size was determined through a power analysis based on the data of Experiment 1.","This analysis revealed that a sample size of 25 participants was required to obtain 80% power to detect a difference in response times (RTs) between templatematching trials and template-mismatching trials at least as large as the one observed in Experiment 1, on the basis of a simple t contrast.","On the basis of the same power analysis, we continued data acquisition for Experiment 3 until 25 participants met our inclusion criteria (3 participants were replaced).","To get an impression of 9-month-olds' theta and alpha frequencies for violation-of-expectation stimuli, we visually explored the theta and alpha power in existing data before conducting the present study.","Specifically, the evoked spectral power was obtained by complex Morlet's wavelets (Morlet parameter m = 7) at a resolution of 0.5 Hz for theta and alpha for each channel individually (Formulas 1 to 4 in Kaspar, Hassler, Martens, Trujillo-Barreto, &amp; Gruber, 2010).","The grand mean SSVEP signal was quantified by subtracting a prestimulus baseline (from -0.5 s to -0.25 s) from the SSVEP power.","The main analysis focused on the difference in SSVEP power for a 1-s time window after the onset of the outcome stimulus (3-4 s), in contrast to the 1-s presentation of the second picture of the sequence (1.5-2.5 s), subtracted as a baseline.","Subsequently, we averaged signal power at individual frequencies across occipital and parietal electrodes (O1, Oz, O2, P3, P4, Pz, P7, P8) for all statistical comparisons.","Throughout the stimulus presentation (0-4.5 s), theta and alpha SSVEPs were significantly above the prestimulus baseline level, both ts(37) &gt; 7.46, p &lt; .001, with higher SSVEP power for entrained theta compared with alpha, t(37) = 3.38, p = .002.","Post hoc t tests revealed a sharp increase in SSVEP power for the onset of unexpected compared with expected outcomes for the theta stimulation, t(37) = 2.85, p = .007, but no difference was found for the alpha stimulation, t(37) = 0.41, p = .684 (Fig. 2b).","It is also possible that compositionality increases in other areas, such as the VWFA, but the increase is undetectable because these areas have far fewer voxels and therefore weaker statistical power.","Thus, we chose to assign all our participants to the text-completion and self-paced reading tasks in order to maximize statistical power for those tasks.","Although the prime minister's political power will not be absolute, she will wield considerable influence in the government.","In both countries, the change in event expectation induced by the election itself had a powerful effect on production and comprehension.","But this article reports a previously undocumented powerful bias affecting linguistic behavior: When people refer to the next head of government, even when the set of candidates has been narrowed down to two, they disprefer she references relative to expectations regarding the referent's gender.","Camerer et al. (2018) showed that the effect size of replications is on average about 50% of the original effect size, so we aimed for 90% power to detect an effect of half the original size (d = 0.29, i.e., 50% of 0.58; note that the preregistration incorrectly mentions 50% of d = 0.66, implying a lower minimum required sample size of 366).","Third, polygenic scores, which index the genetic liability that each individual carries for a specific trait, are notably powerful for educational attainment and now predict approximately 10% of the variation in years of education (Lee et al., 2018), a finding with potential social implications (Plomin &amp; von Stumm, 2018).","Third, we tested whether the power of polygenic scores was greater for individuals who were reared with their biological relatives than for adoptees.","Notably, this polygenic-score analysis is better powered than the SNP heritability analysis, because it capitalizes on the power of the large discovery sample (N = 643,003).","We note that subsampling reduced the statistical power to detect differences within and between groups across time.","The difference between the variance explained in nonadopted individuals and adoptees suggests that about half of the predictive power of polygenic scores for educational attainment comes from passive gene-environment correlation.","By showing that polygenic scores for education are twice as powerful in nonadopted individuals compared with adoptees, we suggest that genetic influence on educational attainment is magnified when individuals are reared by their close genetic relatives, with whom they share both genes and environments.","Thus, the effects of passive gene-environment correlation may contribute even more than half of the predictive power of polygenic scores for education, as we estimated here.","However, highpowered preregistered studies (Garrison, Finley, &amp; Schmeichel, 2019;Hagger et al., 2016), meta-analyses (Carter, Kofler, Forster, &amp; McCullough, 2015), and theoretical reviews (Friese, Loschelder, Gieseler, Frankenbach, &amp; Inzlicht, 2019;Inzlicht &amp; Friese, 2019) suggest that laboratory depletion effects are small or potentially nonexistent and that previous work suffers from limitations such as ineffective experimental manipulations and low statistical power.","Second, we used a completely within-subjects design to reduce error variance and increase statistical power (Francis, Milyavskaya, Lin, &amp; Inzlicht, 2018).","We conducted sensitivity analyses using the Power Analysis for General ANOVA Designs program for the R Shiny app (Westfall, 2016), which suggested that roughly 130 participants would provide at least 80% statistical power to detect the hypothesized effect.","To reduce error variance and increase statistical power, we used within-subjects designs in all four studies.","Nevertheless, the small but meaningful effect size (reduced boundary effect: d = -0.15) suggests that researchers hoping to examine similar effects should use within-subjects designs to ensure sufficient statistical power, especially given that the boundary effect was present even after we accounted for within-subjects learning effects in our studies.","From Experiment 3 onward, sample size was determined so as to reach a power of .9 for the context effect observed in Experiment 2 on the basis of a simplified, no-pooling version of the logistic regression model (we fitted a logistic function for each of the participants on noncentered data and then tested the mean context coefficient against zero), t(23) = 2.82, p &lt;

it allows full control over the input to the spectral analysis, so we can test our intuitions about what groundtruth mechanism could have generated a given pattern of results.","At no point was the power of an \"oscillation\" manipulated.","Although our simulation did not involve modulating oscillatory (SSVEP) power, our results bear close qualitative similarity with the effects reported by Köster et al.","For unexpected outcomes, we observed a frequencyselective theta-power increase during theta stimulation but not alpha stimulation (Fig.","We then created time-frequency plots (averaged over the expected and unexpected conditions), as well as summary plots showing theta and alpha time courses separately for the expected-and unexpected-outcome conditions (baseline corrected as in the original study by subtracting the average power between 1.5 s and 2.5 s with respect to the onset of the flicker stimulus), as in Köster et al.","Most importantly, our model does not incorporate any modulation of band-limited theta (or alpha) power.","Köster et al. report a theta-power increase during 4-Hz stimulation (infant theta range), whereas a similar effect on theta power was absent during 6-Hz stimulation (alpha range) in a control analysis.","Second, note that the control result-the absence of a theta-power (4-Hz) increase during 6-Hz stimulation-stems from a special case.","In contrast to the two main analyses-theta power during theta-range stimulation and alpha power during alpha-range stimulationthe control analysis looks into one frequency range (theta) whereas the 6-Hz stimulation drives an SSVEP in the other (alpha).","The replication projects published thus far have undoubtedly succeeded in raising awareness of methodological shortcomings with regard to the power of research designs and the pitfalls of postdiction, culminating in the advent of Registered Reports (Nosek &amp; Lakens, 2014) and a widespread adoption of preregistration of research designs in psychology (Nosek &amp; Lindsay, 2018).","A single replication attempt, especially if insufficiently powered, provides only limited information about whether a prior research result is robust.","Participating research teams chose studies to replicate from a predefined sampling frame and subsequently conducted independent replication attempts \"using high-powered designs and original materials when available\" (Open Science Collaboration, 2015, abstract).","For example, a failed replication attempt might not be able to detect a true effect if it is itself underpowered, whereas a high-powered replication might uncover an effect that is orders of magnitude smaller than the original effect.","The \"small-telescopes\" approach of Simonsohn ( 2015) is based on the idea of detectability in that it tests whether the effect obtained in a replication study is smaller than an effect size that the original study had only 33% power to detect.","An obvious question is whether my inability to reject the null hypothesis is the result of the study being inadequately powered.","On the basis of the estimated standard errors in the main specification, I had 80% power to detect an effect of around 0.2 in IHS units for successful replications and around 0.18 IHS units for failed replications at an α of .05, corresponding to 0.19 and 0.17 standard deviations, respectively.","This issue is particularly important because the power calculations underlying the RP:P replications were based on the original effect sizes.","In the presence of a type-M error (Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014), this practice is likely to result in replication attempts that are themselves not sufficiently powered to detect the effects of interest and hence could render some of the evidence too weak to shift researchers' beliefs.","With that sample size, the minimum detectable effect size with statistical power at the recommended .80 level was a Cohen's d of 0.32 for mean comparisons between participants who received a good signal and participants who received a bad signal and a Cohen's d of 0.46 for mean comparisons between the four possible combinations of signals (Cohen, 1988).","In the current work, we applied the boosting approach to empower individuals holding misperceptions to understand the value of and to identify scientific consensus.","Moreover, the current work extends existing research by demonstrating that empowering people to understand and iden tify scientific consensus can help to correct a false belief even further, as is demonstrated in the case of genetically engineered food.","Communicating scientific consensus, paired with science-communication campaigns focused on boosting understanding and identification of scientific consensus, is a promising place to start. boosting consensus reasoning is intended to empower individuals to make the best use of already available information.","This empowerment, combined with exposure to information about a scientific consensus embedded in a naturalistic environment, might also yield less resistance than more direct means of persuasion, because direct means of persuasion may be perceived as deceiving or as a threat to freedom (Fransen et al., 2015).","This smaller sample was enough to detect a medium effect size (η p 2 = .066) with .90 power and an α of .05 for Hypothesis 2 (Faul et al., 2009).","One explanation for these tentative findings could be a lack of power.","We addressed this issue in Experiment 3 by conducting a high-powered replication.","The follow-up measure was dropped in order to reserve all our resources for testing the immediate effects with high power.","Instead, we conducted an a priori power analysis based on the comparison between the boost+ and consensus-only conditions of Experiment 2 (see the Supplemental Material; final N = 854, 65.81% female, mean age = 35.90 years, SD = 12.92).","In the case of climate change, we found moderate evidence against the effectiveness of an extensive boost (the boost+ condition) to correct a misperception (BF 10 = 0.18; increase in belief in true statement: d = 0.04), whereas a high-powered experiment about genetically engineered food yielded extreme evidence in favor of boosting consensus reasoning to aid participants to come to an accurate belief (BF 10 = 309.98; decrease in belief in false statement: d = -0.35).","Finally, it could be that we did not have enough statistical power in the climate-change experiment to find a true difference between the boost+ and the consensus-only conditions.","Even if a true effect existed in our sample of climate-change deniers similar in size to the one we found in Experiment 3 about genetically engineered food, then the experiment about climate change was underpowered (achieved power ~55%).","Boosting consensus reasoning empowers individuals to identify misinformation in the form of a false consensus by looking at the source of the consensus claim and the expertise of the individuals making up the consensus.","Second, there is an ethical advantage to boosting people's understanding of consensus over only communicating the consensus, namely that its goal is to empower individuals (Hertwig &amp; Grüne-Yanoff, 2017).","Conversely, boosting is meant not to persuade but to empower individuals to be able to understand and make the best use of the available information regarding a scientific consensus, whether that consensus is in line with their preferred beliefs or not.","We are hesitant in interpreting this result because the second experiment appeared to be underpowered to detect an effect of the boost+ condition compared with the consensus-only condition, especially at follow-up.","To conclude, the current work extends existing research by demonstrating that empowering individuals who hold misperceptions to use scientific consensus in deciding whether or not something is true can help to correct these false beliefs.","Ninety subjects participated in three experiments for payment or course credit: 20 participants in Experiment 1 (14 female;

i.e., Bonferroni corrected for tests in 10 frequency bins).","For significant peaks in the power spectrum, determined as described above, we compared the corresponding phase angles between the TMT A and TMT B conditions using a parametric Watson-Williams two-sample test (Berens, 2009).","Specifically, 6-Hz fluctuations for TMT A trials timelocked to template A were significantly larger than the power observed in our distribution of surrogate data (Fig. 4 we observed a significant peak at 9.7 Hz for TMT B trials if time-locked to template B (p &lt; .001, d = 0.39).","Note, however, that it is also possible that the permutation approach we applied lacked the statistical power to detect peaks in both conditions.","However, observed patterns have been partly contradictory and have limited discriminative power (DePaulo et al., 2003).","Too many variables may lead to overfitting and poor out-of-sample prediction power.","However, to ensure that our study would have sufficient power to detect a possible mediation effect, we used the mc_ power_med app (Schoemann et al., 2017) to calculate sample-size requirements for a basic mediation analysis.","Assuming the smallest effect size of interest (r = .3) between each of the pathways (a, b, and c′), we estimated that a total sample size of 240 participants would provide power of .95 to detect a significant mediation effect with an α of .05.","We aimed to achieve power of .95 (rather than the field standard of .8) to allow for potential increases in residual errors arising from online data collection and to increase our power to detect other potential effects (e.g., moderation) in the analyses.","The total mooddisturbance score has been shown to have good psychometric properties, including high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .96) and powerful convergent validity for both positive and negative affect;

Fiske, 2023), fostering discrimination against powerful women (Masser &amp; Abrams, 2004) and opposition to genderbased policies (Hideg &amp; Ferris, 2013).","In contrast, the patronizing content of benevolent sexism indirectly enforces men's power through gender-role norms (Bareket &amp; Fiske, 2023), undermining women's career aspirations (Kuchynka et al., 2017) and willingness to challenge gender inequality (Becker &amp; Wright, 2011;Hammond &amp; Sibley, 2011).","Benevolent sexism is theorized to facilitate intimacy, whereas hostile sexism maintains men's power.","However, this power dynamic allows the punitive effects of benevolent to manifest within such relationships.","For example, benevolent sexism promotes women's acceptance of their partner's autocratic behavior (Moya et al., 2007) and predicts beliefs that normalize men's power over their partners (Chen et al., 2009).","In addition to testing these two opposing associations, we also assessed hostile sexism, which we expected to be positively related to tolerance of both outsider and spousal violence, consistent with its overt enforcement of men's power (Bareket &amp; Fiske, 2023).","The three items measuring hostile sexism were \"Women are too easily offended,\" \"Women seek to gain power by controlling men,\" and \"In a fair competition, if women lose to men, they usually complain about being discriminated against.\"","We did not conduct an a priori power analysis.","Because of the extremely large sample size, we determined that there was adequate power to detect the hypothesized effects, and we selected a more conservative critical alpha of p = .01.","As expected, hostile sexism was related to greater tolerance of both outsider violence and spousal violence (see Agadullina et al., 2022), consistent with its function of directly enforcing men's power (Bareket &amp; Fiske, 2023).","Our results provide new evidence for a central proposition of ambivalent sexism theory: Hostile and benevolent sexism have distinct consequences that perpetuate men's societal power.","Hostile sexism reinforces such power with overt aggression.","By contrast, benevolent sexism simultaneously entices women with offers of safety while disempowering them with restrictive expectations.","Its protective appeal goes hand in hand with the disempowerment of women within relationships.","Although the disempowering effects of benevolent sexism are well documented, the implications for women's power within relationships are underresearched (Hammond &amp; Overall, 2017).","Thus, prior research typically focused on indirect forms of disempowerment (e.g., benevolent sexism undermining women's career aspirations; Kuchynka et al., 2017).","It can legitimize men's power over women directly-at least within the traditional relationships that are prevalent in non-WEIRD societies such as India.","High statistical power also meant that our estimates of the hypothesized associations were very precise.","These features made it a particularly convenient place to find relevant content to analyze and an important context to study: Its discourse can powerfully shape decisions of voters as well as lawmakers (Brady et al., 2021;Frimer et al., 2022).","Our team of coders was not large enough to code, by hand, a quarter million tweets, so we took steps to identify a subset that was more feasible for our coders, with the additional goal of maximizing their hit rates for engaging and dismissing tweets, which in turn would maximize the power of our analyses.","This provided 80% power to detect differences between engaging and dismissing-d = 0.38 (Study 1a) and d = 0.47 (Study 1b).","Study 2a participants provided two observations, and 2b participants six; in each case we targeted 1,200 total observations (preregistration links noted in the open practices section provide a priori power analyses justifying this sample size).","We initially targeted 240 participants-160 representing the majority who rarely or never react to politicians' tweets, and 80 of the more unusual participants who frequently do so (for a priori power analyses justifying this sample size, see the preregistration).","Sensitivity analyses indicated we had over 95% power to detect even small effects (d = 0.22).","Regarding the first explanation, we offer a psychological profile of people who frequently react to politicians' tweets, thereby powerfully shaping perceived norms and real-world outcomes.","Statistical learning is a powerful mechanism that enables the rapid extraction of regularities from sensory inputs.","The modest sample size in our experiments might not guarantee adequate power for relating the magnitude of the effect of statistical learning on conscious access to individual participants' awareness of the regularities (Vadillo et al., 2020).","As mentioned above, the results here provide only weak evidence for the level of awareness of the regularity of the participants and need to be interpreted with caution because of the limitations of the methods (e.g., lack of statistical power).","Again, these findings provide only weak evidence for the absence of a relation between awareness of the regularity and conscious access, and they should be approached with caution because of the methodological constraints (e.g., lack of statistical power).","After reviewing the effect size (Cohen's d = 0.34) of a previous study that used the bias-free b-CFS paradigm to measure conscious access (Litwin et al., 2023), we concluded that a sample of 55 participants was needed for an experimental power of 80% with an alpha level of 0.05 for a planned one-tailed paired-samples t test (power calculation performed in G*Power).","In numerous studies, statistical learning was suggested as a powerful mechanism for determining what information is prioritized in perception (e.g., the effect of statistical learning on visual attention; Chun &amp; Jiang, 1998;Wang &amp; Theeuwes, 2018).","This is staggering, given that a large body of work exists showing powerful attentional-enhancement effects in both adults (Bashinski &amp; Bacharach, 1980;Eriksen &amp; Hoffman, 1974;Jonides, 1980) and children (Lane &amp; Pearson, 1983;Pozuelos et al., 2014;Wainwright &amp; Bryson, 2002) that are observed even when no filtering is required during attentional selection.","Our power analysis indicated that a sample of 42 participants per age group would provide 80% power to detect differences in group means (α = .05).","However, the achieved sample is still powered (77%) to detect a medium-sized effect (0.55), so we moved our stopping rule to 35 (our obtained sample) prior to data analysis.","This power analysis indicated that a sample size of 60 participants per age group would allow for at least 80% power to detect group differences at the standard alpha error probability of .05; however, we did not reach our full child-sample goal because of COVID-19.","The sample size for Experiment 2 was selected according to a simulation-based bootstrap power analysis so as to give in excess of 95% power to detect a betweenparticipants effect size estimated from permuted data from Experiment 1 (estimated between-participants Cohen's d = 0.63).","For the triangle-completion task, we generated 1,000 data sets for the turn angle and distance using either planar or spherical geometry prediction using the Mixedpower R package (Kreidler et al., 2021;Kumle et al., 2021).","With a sample size of 20, the power was 100%."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>id<\/th>\n      <th>text<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":5,"dom":"tip","columnDefs":[{"name":"id","targets":0},{"name":"text","targets":1}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[5,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

<p>After a quick skim through the 744 results, we can see that words
like “powerful” are never reporting a power analysis, so we should try
to exclude them.</p>
<p>We can use regex to make our text search a bit more specific. The
following pattern requires that power is followed optionally by “ed” and
then by a word border (like a space or full stop), so will match “power”
and “powered”, but not “powerful”.</p>

is possible that less-consistent effects were observed on trials with errors because of reduced power to detect an effect on these trials, which by design were less numerous (~25%).","Figure 1 shows that CY had very little predictive power for CLIM, but the fit in the transposed plot has an obvious bell-shaped curve.","The present findings demonstrate the long-range power of self-control in predicting success in life and single out self-control as a key target for early intervention programs.","Sample size was calculated with an a priori power analysis, using the effect sizes reported by Küpper et al. (2014), who used identical procedures, materials, and dependent measures.","We determined that a minimum sample size of 7 per group would be necessary for 95% power to detect an effect.","For the first part of the task, 11 static visual images, one from each of the scenes in the film were presented once each on a black background for 2 s using Power-Point.","A sample size of 26 per group was required to ensure 80% power to detect this difference at the 5% significance level.","A sample size of 18 per condition was required in order to ensure an 80% power to detect this difference at the 5% significance level.","The 13,500 selected loan requests conservatively achieved a power of .98 for an effect size of .07 at an alpha level of .05.","Power analysis and sample size.","On the basis of simulations over a range of expected effect sizes for contrasts of fMRI activity, we estimated that a sample size of 24 would provide .80 power at a conservative brainwide alpha threshold of .002 (although such thresholds ideally should be relaxed for detecting activity in regions where an effect is predicted).","This required a second power estimate.","Stimulus sample size was determined via power analysis of the sole existing similar study, which used neural activity to predict Internet downloads of music (Berns &amp; Moore, 2012).","The effect size from that study implied that a sample size of 72 loan requests would be required to achieve .80 power at an alpha level of .05.","An a priori power analysis showed that 40 participants per condition should have 80% power to detect an effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.63.","This sample size yielded greater than 80% power to detect group differences of the size we had previously observed in studies of awareness in eyeblink conditioning (e.g., Lovibond et al., 2011).","Furthermore, the effect of go and no-go runs is expected to be much smaller in the unpredictable condition, so much larger sample sizes would be needed to obtain sufficient statistical power in this condition.","Sample size was determined using a power analysis (G*Power Version 3.1.9.2; Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007) based on previous studies that have investigated the link between decision outcomes and self-reported feelings using within-subjects designs.","We determined that a sample size of 59 participants would achieve 85% power to detect an effect size of 0.401 with an alpha of .05.","Many psychology studies are statistically underpowered.","In Study 1, we surveyed 291 published research psychologists and found large discrepancies between their reports of their preferred amount of power and the actual power of their studies (calculated from their reported typical cell size, typical effect size, and acceptable alpha).","Furthermore, in Study 2, 89% of the 214 respondents overestimated the power of specific research designs with a small expected effect size, and 95% underestimated the sample size needed to obtain .80 power for detecting a small effect.","Neither researchers' experience nor their knowledge predicted the bias in their self-reported power intuitions.","Because many respondents reported that they based their sample sizes on rules of thumb or common practice in the field, we recommend that researchers conduct and report formal power analyses for their studies.","Reducing the possibility of Type II errors is another important consideration in improving the quality of studies, however: Studies should be well powered (Fiedler, Kutzner, &amp; Krueger, 2012;Simmons et al., 2011).","It has long been argued that researchers should conduct formal power analyses before starting data collection (Cohen, 1965(Cohen,, 1990), yet it continues to be the case that many studies in the psychological literature are statistically underpowered (Bakker et al., 2012;Cohen, 1990;Maxwell, 2004).","Specifically, given the typical effect sizes (ESs) and sample sizes reported in the psychological literature, the statistical power of a typical two-group between-subjects design has been estimated to be less than .50 (Cohen, 1990) or even .35 (Bakker et al., 2012).","These low power estimates appear to contradict the finding that more than 90% of published studies in the literature have p values below the typical threshold for significance (i.e., α = .05; Fanelli, 2010;Sterling, Rosenbaum, &amp; Weinkam, 1995).","Despite the centrality of power in NHST ( Gigerenzer, 2004), formal power analyses are rarely reported in the literature.","Sedlmeier and Gigerenzer (1989) found that none of the 54 articles published in the 1984 volume of the Journal of Abnormal Psychology reported the power of the statistical tests that were presented.","In a more recent and fairly representative sample of 271 psychological articles that involved the use of NHST (Bakker &amp; Wicherts, 2011), only 3% of the authors explicitly discussed power as a consideration in designing their studies.","Thus, it appears that sample-size decisions are hardly ever based on formal and explicitly reported (a priori) power considerations.","Here, we consider another explanation of the common failure to conduct sufficiently powerful studies, namely, researchers' intuitions about statistical power.","In addition, when Greenwald (1975) asked social psychologists what the acceptable Type II error rate was, the average response was around .27, which means that an acceptable level of power would be .73, which again is markedly higher than the overall power estimates for published studies, as reported by Cohen (1990) and Bakker et al.","These results suggest that researchers may intuitively overestimate the power associated with their own research and that of others (i.e., in their role as reviewers).","Given the centrality of power in the debate regarding reproducibility and replicability of research in psychology and beyond (e.g., Asendorpf et al., 2013;Button et al., 2013;Gilbert, King, Pettigrew, &amp; Wilson, 2016;Open Science Collaboration, 2015), we surveyed psychology researchers on their practices, intuitions, and goals related to statistical power.","In our first study, respondents assumed the role of either researcher (reporting on their own studies) or reviewer (assessing their peers' studies) in answering questions about typical and acceptable cell sizes (ns), ESs, power levels, and alpha levels.","In our second study, respondents estimated the actual power of several research designs and the sample size that would be required to achieve a power of .80 in various research designs.","Specifically, here we discuss the respondents' descriptions of how they generally determined their sample size (researcher condition only, because answers to the corresponding question in the reviewer condition were hard to classify) and their assessments of the acceptable Type I error rate, the power level regarded as satisfactory, the cell size typically considered sufficient, and the typically expected ES (in Cohen's d ) for an independent-samples t test.","A power analysis was mentioned by 93 (47%) of the respondents (although 20 of these respondents, or 22%, also mentioned practical constraints, such as available time and money).","Furthermore, 45 respondents (23%) mentioned some rule of thumb (e.g., 20 subjects per condition), 41 respondents (21%) based sample sizes on the common practice in their field of research, and 18 respondents (9%) wanted as many subjects as possible, to have the highest possible power to detect an effect.","As the distributions were not normal and included outliers (histograms and medians are presented in the Supplemental Material), we report the trimmed means (M t s; 20% trimming) and used robust statistics to increase power and to protect against an incorrect estimation of the Type I error rate (Bakker &amp; Wicherts, 2014;Welch, 1938;Wilcox, 2012;Yuen, 1974).","The average reported acceptable levels for α and power were .05 and .80, respectively.","Responses to these questions, in particular, seemed to reflect a common standard, as 83% of our respondents reported that the acceptable α level is .05, and 69% reported that power of .80 is sufficient.","However, for an independent-samples t test with 20 to 25 subjects in each condition and d of 0.5 (medium ES), the actual power lies between .34 and .41, which is approximately half the power that the respondent mentioned.","Considering that 53% of the respondents in the researcher condition indicated that they did not generally conduct power analyses and 23% reported using some rule of thumb, we wondered whether respondents' intuitive power analyses were accurate.","To investigate this, we calculated the power of a study with α, ES, and cell size equal to the trimmed means obtained in Study 1, using the pwr package in R (Champely, 2009).","Such a study would have power of .35.","(When we calculated power separately for each respondent's reported values of α, ES, and n, we found that the trimmed mean power across respondents was .40.)","We also calculated the required cell size given the trimmed means for α, ES, and power, and found that it would be 105 subjects, which is 3 times as many subjects as respondents' trimmed mean for n.","A robust within-subjects Yuen t test (Wilcox, 2012;Yuen, 1974) indicated that respondents' reported acceptable power levels differed significantly from the calculated power based on their responses to the other questions, t(171) = 19.38, p &lt; .001, ξ = .82, 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference = [.36, .44].","We also calculated the bias for each respondent individually (calculated power -reported power).","The trimmed mean bias was -.34; 80% of the respondents showed a negative bias (calculated power lower than desired power), and 33% showed a negative bias with an absolute value larger than .5.","A majority of the respondents in Study 1 reported that power of .80 is satisfactory, and this is the common standard advised by Cohen (1965) and other researchers.","The goal of Study 2 was to measure researchers' power intuitions more directly, by asking them to estimate the power of research designs with α, ES, and N specified.","Additionally, we presented examples of research designs with α and ES specified, and asked respondents to estimate the number of subjects needed to reach a power of .80.","We did not conduct a formal power analysis because we considered this sample sufficiently large for the purposes of estimation.","The first 3 asked the respondents to estimate the power of independent-samples (two-tailed) t tests in three research situations, which differed in the ES (Cohen's d = 0.20, 0.50, or 0.80); α was set at .05 throughout.","In the next 3 questions, we asked the respondents to estimate the sample sizes required for an independent-samples t test to have a power of .80 given expected ESs (Cohen's d ) of 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80; each ES was accompanied by the corresponding correlation (.10, .24, or .37, respectively), and α was again set at .05.","Next, we tested respondents' understanding of what power is with a single multiple-choice question.","Finally, we asked them to indicate how often they conducted a power analysis (7-point Likert scale), to assess their own statistical knowledge (10-point scale), and to indicate their main subfield of psychological research.","Intuitions about power and sample size.","We calculated the true power of the research designs presented to the respondents using the pwr package in R (Champely, 2009); these values are presented in Table 1 and Figure 1, along with the 20% trimmed means and 95% CIs for the respondents' estimates.","Most respondents were not able to estimate the true power values well.","The true power lay within the 95% CI for only one scenario in the medium-N condition (when d = 0.50) and one scenario in the small-N condition (when d = 0.80).","The vast majority of respondents (89%) overestimated power for the small-ES scenario.","When the ES was large and N was greater than 80, respondents underestimated the power of the t test in the design we presented to them.","A comparable pattern was found when respondents estimated the sample sizes required to obtain a power of .80 in an independent-samples t test, given a specific expected ES.","Whereas respondents estimated, on average, that 216 subjects were needed, 788 subjects would actually be needed to obtain sufficient power in the case of such a small effect.","This might be a carryover effect from the questions asking respondents to estimate the power of research designs (e.g., effect of anchoring and adjustment; Epley &amp; Gilovich, 2006).","To explore possible influences on respondents' power intuitions, we looked at the data from both studies.","First, we found that respondents who reported doing power analyses to determine their sample sizes did not estimate power better than those who did not report conducting power analyses.","Almost half of the respondents in the researcher condition in Study 1 indicated that they generally used a power analysis to determine their sample size (although they might not conduct a power analysis for every single study).","The average calculated power for this group of respondents (M t = .46, 95% CI = [.37, .55]) was not significantly higher than that for the remaining respondents in the researcher condition (M t = .42, 95% CI = [.34, .51]).","Furthermore, the amount of bias did not differ significantly between respondents who mentioned typically doing power analyses (M t = -.31, 95% CI = [-.40, -.22]) and those who did not (M t = -.30, 95% CI = [-.39, -.22]).","Next, for Study 2, we used a principal components analysis to summarize respondents' answers to the questions regarding their understanding of what power means (question correctly answered by 168 respondents, or 78.5%), how often they conducted power analyses, and how good their statistical knowledge was.","The first component explained 50% of the variance, and we used hierarchical regression analyses to investigate whether scores on this component predicted estimates of power and required sample sizes.","The dependent variables were the power and sample-size estimates for each presented research design.","We did not find a significant effect of component score on power estimates for the small-ES scenario (b = -0.01, t = -0.98, p = .329).","However, when the ES was medium or large, respondents with higher component scores had higher (and hence more accurate) power estimates (b = 0.02, t = 2.26, p = .025, and b = 0.04, t = 3.94, p &lt; .001, respectively).","Furthermore, when the specified ES was large, respondents with higher component scores gave smaller estimates of the sample size required to achieve a power of .80 (b = -12.89, t = -2.56, p = .011), which again resulted in estimates closer to the true value.","In Study 1, respondents' self-reported statistical knowledge correlated with neither calculated power nor bias.","In addition, robust regression analyses revealed that number of publications did not significantly predict either calculated power or bias.","Finally, we did not find any significant differences between research fields in Study 1 respondents' calculated power (full results are presented in the Supplemental Material).","With a robust 3 (condition) × 9 (research field) two-way analysis of variance using the trimmed means, we tested for differences between research fields in power and sample-size estimates.","It has long been noted that the statistical power of studies in the psychological literature is typically too low ( Bakker et al., 2012;Cohen, 1990;Maxwell, 2004).","Specifically, for studies of effects expected to have the most typical magnitude, respondents overestimated power and consequently underestimated the required sample size.","When asked about how they normally determined sample sizes in their own studies, more than half of our respondents indicated that they did not use a power analysis, which may explain why such analyses are presented in fewer than 3% of psychological articles (Bakker &amp; Wicherts, 2011).","Much research in psychology appears to be planned without formal power analysis, and many researchers appear to use rather intuitive approaches in determining their sample sizes.","In our first study, the calculated power based on respondents' reported acceptable sample sizes and expected ESs was only half of the power respondents indicated they wanted to achieve.","The power intuitions of more than 75% of respondents resulted in calculated power that was lower than desired.","In our second study, 89% of respondents overestimated the power of studies with small expected ESs, and 95% underestimated the sample size required for sufficient power when the ES was small.","When the expected ES was small, the true sample size needed to reach a power of .80 was more than 3 times the respondents' mean estimate of the required sample size.","In combination with publication bias, the (strategic) use of small sample sizes and research designs that are underpowered results in inflated Type I error rates, biased ES estimates, distorted meta-analytical results, and nonreplicable findings (Bakker et al., 2012;Open Science Collaboration, 2015).","Even researchers who stated that they typically used formal power analyses had poor power intuitions.","In line with earlier work showing the same poor statistical intuitions among general and mathematical psychologists (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1971), our studies indicate that greater self-reported statistical knowledge and experience are not related to better power intuitions in the most common cases (when the ES is small).","Nevertheless, it is possible that some of our respondents were more familiar with other research designs that have different associations between sample size and power (e.g., within-subjects designs are typically more powerful).","However, if experience with research designs had influenced our results, power intuitions should have differed more between subfields that typically use different research designs.","Future research could focus on power intuitions related to other research designs, such as within-subjects and correlational designs.","However, the questions calling for power estimates and the questions calling for sample-size estimates showed the same pattern of results: large discrepancies between estimated and actual values in all conditions when the ES was small.","Furthermore, the response rate in both studies was quite low (26% and 13%, respectively), and researchers who are knowledgeable about power are probably overrepresented in this sample because of their interest in the subject.","Therefore, we expect that a more balanced sample would show even larger overestimation of power and underestimation of required sample sizes in research designs.","Poor intuitions about power may lead to incorrect inferences concerning nonsignificant results.","Researchers often conduct multiple small (and therefore likely underpowered) studies of the same underlying phenomenon (Francis, 2014;Hartgerink, Wicherts, &amp; van Assen, 2015).","Given the flawed power intuitions we observed, it is quite likely that researchers dismiss nonsignificant outcomes in such studies as due to methodological flaws (i.e., \"failed studies\") or feel inclined to interpret nonsignificant outcomes as reflecting a true null effect, although in fact these outcomes might be false negatives ( Hartgerink et al., 2015;Maxwell, Lau, &amp; Howard, 2015).","First, researchers should always conduct a formal power analysis when planning a study (preferably, such an analysis would be part of an institutional review board's approval or part of preregistration of the study), and they should report this power analysis in their manuscript, together with a description of their sample.","This will force researchers to explicate their samplesize decisions and will likely lead to better-powered studies.","Second, considering that often no appropriate ES estimation is available and that our results indicate that intuitions for exponential power functions are often suboptimal and potentially linear, we recommend that power analyses be accompanied by inspection of the implications of a range of ES estimates, especially at the lower end of this range.","This will help researchers understand the exponential relations involved in statistical power and the considerable impact of seemingly small changes in ES estimates (see also Perugini, Gallucci, &amp; Costantini, 2014).","Third, reviewers should check whether indeed a formal power analysis has been conducted (Asendorpf et al., 2013) and whether it is sound.","Both parties may misestimate the power of studies, regardless of their self-assessed statistical expertise.","There is really only one way to improve studies: power them up.","Although it is the largest of its kind regarding both the number of twins in the sample and the number of assessments, our sample was relatively small compared with the samples in conventional twin studies, and our power to detect small effects was limited.","We chose three age groups for adolescents as a compromise between the increased sensitivity that comes with increasing numbers of groups and the loss of power this engenders.","We aimed to collect data from 200 participants, in order to have 80% power to detect an interaction effect corresponding to a Cohen's d of 0.40.","We aimed to collect data from 340 participants to have 80% power to detect a small to medium effect (i.e., the size of the effect found in Study 1).","The sample size was based on our decision to recruit as many ASC participants as possible and then calculate the number of control participants necessary to provide approximately 70% power to detect a difference between groups given the difference in proportions of consistent choices observed between the low-and high-AQ groups in the AQ study, which was conducted first (higher power would require unfeasibly large numbers of control participants; Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, &amp; Lang, 2009).","The sample sizes were chosen to achieve more than 80% power to detect a medium-sized effect (d = 0.5) in simple between-groups comparisons (Faul et al., 2009).","These interventions harnessed both competitiveness and the power of social norms.","An initial power analysis suggested that a sample size between 30 and 46 observers would achieve the desired effect size (Cohen's f = 0.20-0.25, α = .05, β = 0.90).","Finally, in addition to conducting DNA analyses, we used twin data to obtain the first well-powered estimate of the degree to which intergenerational educational attainment is heritable.","This sample size has been shown to be sufficient to fit moderately complex structural equation models with adequate power (e.g., Wolf, Harrington, Clark, &amp; Miller, 2013).","This sample size has been shown to be sufficient to fit moderately complex structural equation models with adequate power (e.g., Wolf, Harrington, Clark, &amp; Miller, 2013).","Although signaling wealth through greater consumption acts as a way for poorer groups to restore feelings of self-integrity (Sivanathan &amp; Pettit, 2010) and personal power (Rucker &amp; Galinsky, 2008, 2009), conspicuous consumption can also perpetuate financial hardship because it limits self-investment (Moav &amp; Neeman, 2012).","These methods were used in the context of a larger study; sample size from that study was determined to be sufficient to detect the hypothesized associations between oxytocin and targets' perceptions if the effect were moderate in size, at 94% power, so all available urine samples were assayed.","Second, the fWHR literature consists of predominantly underpowered studies based on very small samples.","To date, however, fWHR research has not produced strong evidence for such links; male fWHR has been reported to correlate only weakly with some of the Psychopathic Personality Inventory-Revised scales (Anderl et al., 2016;Geniole et al., 2014) and with Anderson's Personal Sense of Power scale (Haselhuhn &amp; Wong, 2012).","Power analysis for RSA is not straightforward.","We used G*Power 3.1 (Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, &amp; Lang, 2009) to calculate desired sample sizes.","We based our power analysis on previous research on the optimistic learning bias (Garrett &amp; Sharot, 2014;Garrett et al., 2014;Korn et al., 2014;Kuzmanovic et al., 2015;Moutsiana et al., 2013;Sharot, Guitart-Masip, et al., 2012;Sharot, Kanai, et al., 2012;Sharot et al., 2011) Time Fig.","To achieve a power of .90, we needed a sample of 67 participants.","We needed 100 participants per condition for a power of .80.","To obtain .90 power to detect the effect size in the difference between identifiable and unidentifiable strangers found in Study 2a, we aimed to recruit 470 participants after exclusion of participants with a BDI score higher than 12.","Our goal was to obtain .90 power to detect a small effect size (f ) of .1 at the standard .05 alpha error probability; therefore, we aimed to recruit 280 participants with a BDI score lower than 12 (see the preregistered material for further details).","To achieve a power of .90, we needed a sample of 67 participants, and for a medium correlation (r = .3) between learning bias and charity donation, we needed 80 participants per condition for a power of .80.","Power analyses, measures, conditions, and exclusions are reported in the Supplemental Material available online.","For example, we did not have enough statistical power to examine interactions between the polygenic score and SES, and we restricted our analyses to two broad indicators of antisocial behavior-criminal offending and life-course-persistent antisocial behavior-rather than zooming in on finer distinctions.","To increase power and reduce the number of significance tests, we combined the data of the 4-and 5-, 6-and 7-, 8-and 9-, 10-and 11-, and 17-to 19-year-olds, resulting in five groups.","First, sample sizes are usually small, meaning that studies are very underpowered (Gangestad et al., 2016).","Note that women's masculinity preferences tended to be stronger when they were using the combined oral contraceptive pill (although not significantly so), suggesting that a lack of power did not prevent detection of the hypothesized weaker masculinity preferences when women are using the combined oral contraceptive pill.","Several studies across different cultures have found an association between a relatively tall stature and holding a position of power (Handwerker &amp; Crosbie, 1982;Werner, 1982).","In the dictator game, one player has unconditional power over resource allocation, while in the ultimatum game, that player's allocation decision can be rejected-thus posing a risk of retaliation by the opponent.","In Study 1, opponent height did not affect resource allocation in the dictator game, but having a taller opponent was related to taking more resources in the dictator game (allocator has unconditional power) compared with the ultimatum game (allocator has conditional power, opponent can retaliate).","The results imply that participant height is most important in predicting competitive behaviors in an absolute-power situation (the dictator game), regardless of opponent height.","In line with recent guidance (Finkel, Eastwick, &amp; Reis, 2015), as well as recruitment and financial constraints, the sample size was decided prior to data collection on the basis of the large sample sizes used in previous relationship studies (e.g., McNulty et al., 2013) and combined with a diary design to maximize statistical power.","Whereas the predictive power of self-report measures has been challenged ( Joel et al., 2017), the present multimethod approach provides new insights that may help relationship research move forward.","Once results were obtained, a power analysis (paired-samples t test, Cohen's d = 0.6, α = .05, one-tailed) indicated a minimum of 19 participants to reach a power of .8 (the effect size from Experiment 1 was computed as if reflecting a between-participants design, and thus, this power analysis revealed itself to be conservative).","There are at least two interpretations of these new results: One interpretation is that the original study lacked sufficient power to detect an interaction effect.","Indeed, the study had 46% power to detect a mediumsized effect (OR = 2 or Cohen's d = 0.30).","More generally, any factor affecting the distribution of p values and their frequency in the interval .05 to .10, such as the statistical power of research, p hacking, or merely the reporting of statistical results, will affect the percentage of articles reporting one or more results as marginally significant.","Using the same data set as Hartgerink (2016), we also extracted information on the degrees of freedom across disciplines for a supplementary analysis of statistical power in psychology articles.","Consecutively, this frequency of p values is affected by trends in the reporting of p values and trends in the statistical power of psychological research over time, although there is, at most, a small increase in power over time in our data (see the Supplemental Material).","Note that possible trends in p-value reporting and power do not affect the percentage of p values reported as marginally significant, as that percentage is conditional on the p value being between .05 and .10.","This sample size was large enough for even small effects to be detected with 80% power (at α = .05).","Second, a simulation demonstrated that data sets of similar magnitude and distributional properties could have, in principle, favored alternative models with close to 100% power.","Simulating data in this manner also allowed us to ask about power and model selection: If we fitted both the g-factor latent change score model and the more complex mutualism model to data generated under the g-factor model, how often did we (rightly) prefer the g-factor model?","In 999 of 1,000 iterations, the g factor was preferred, suggesting 99.9% power to prefer the g-factor model if it was indeed the data-generating mechanism.","Finally, we investigated statistical power within the latent change score model; given our sample size and model specification, what is our statistical power to detect a reliable parameter estimate for the key (coupling) parameters?","With our current model specification and sample size, we had 73% power to detect a small coupling effect (r = .1, as defined by Gignac &amp; Szodorai, 2016) but effectively 100% power to detect intermediate (r = .2) and large (r = .3) effects.","Under the assumption of medium correlations between measurements (r = .3), an alpha error probability of .05, and a power of .8, we used G*Power (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007) to calculate that a total sample size of 37 would be required to achieve a medium effect size (η p 2 ) of .06 for betweenconditions differences.","On the basis of a power analysis in G*Power 3 (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007), we estimated that a sample size of 24 would be needed to provide 80% statistical power to achieve a medium effect size (d = 0.6) on binary choices using a one-sample t test against a 50% chance level and an alpha of .05.","Target sample size was determined in the same way as for Experiment 1, by conducting a power analysis in G*Power 3 (Faul et al., 2007).","It was estimated that a sample size of 24 would be needed to provide 80% statistical power.","We did not conduct formal power analyses prior to collecting data.","Such analyses are complex with multiple random effects because power varies with the number of stimuli, the number of participants, and the variance associated with each random effect (Westfall, Kenny, &amp; Judd, 2014).","With 30 stimuli, a medium effect size (d) of 0.50, and reasonable assumptions about variance-partitioning components, power of .80 could be achieved with 30 participants (Westfall et al., 2014).","With 30 stimuli and a sample size of 100, our studies would have a power of at least .80 to detect an effect (d) of approximately 0.40.","On the basis of the standard errors of the estimates, we also computed the approximate statistical power (1 -β) of these tests for a significance level (α) of 1% to allow evaluation of the conclusiveness of nonsignificant effects.","As an effect size under the alternative hypothesis, the median OR reported by Lu and colleagues (OR = 1.065) was used for the power calculations.","Strikingly, even though the power was above 96% for all 15 crime types, only the OR for antisocial behavior was significant (OR = 1.025, p = .005), which was the most prevalent type of crime in the data set and included offenses such as nuisance, inconsiderate neighbors, vandalism, street drinking, Note: Percentages in the left-hand column refer to the relative frequency of the crime category relative to the total number of crimes.","Moreover, the GAM used splines to model monthly seasonal trends and the geographic locations of districts, whereas the GLM assumed (discrete) fixed effects for months. b = estimate for the effect of the z-standardized pollution variable in a negative binomial regression; OR = odds ratio; 1 -β = approximate statistical power of the Wald test for a significance level (α) equal to 1% based on the median effect size reported by Lu, Lee, Gino, and Galinsky (2018; OR = 1.065); BF 01 = Bayes factor against the incremental effect of air pollution. littering, begging, or fireworks misuse.","Likewise, none of the frequentist Wald tests were significant at the nominal level (α) of 1% despite the high statistical power for all dependent variables (1 -β ≥ 93%).","That is, analyses of both Emotionality (p = .676) and its Anxiety facet (p = .652) clearly failed to reach statistical significance, whereas both tests had an approximate statistical power (1 -β) of 92% for detecting a small effect (i.e., an OR of 1.25 for a z-standardized predictor).","This effect was replicated in Experiments 2 and 3, following a power analysis based on the data of Experiment 1.","For Experiment 2, the sample size was determined through a power analysis based on the data of Experiment 1.","This analysis revealed that a sample size of 25 participants was required to obtain 80% power to detect a difference in response times (RTs) between templatematching trials and template-mismatching trials at least as large as the one observed in Experiment 1, on the basis of a simple t contrast.","On the basis of the same power analysis, we continued data acquisition for Experiment 3 until 25 participants met our inclusion criteria (3 participants were replaced).","To get an impression of 9-month-olds' theta and alpha frequencies for violation-of-expectation stimuli, we visually explored the theta and alpha power in existing data before conducting the present study.","Specifically, the evoked spectral power was obtained by complex Morlet's wavelets (Morlet parameter m = 7) at a resolution of 0.5 Hz for theta and alpha for each channel individually (Formulas 1 to 4 in Kaspar, Hassler, Martens, Trujillo-Barreto, &amp; Gruber, 2010).","The grand mean SSVEP signal was quantified by subtracting a prestimulus baseline (from -0.5 s to -0.25 s) from the SSVEP power.","The main analysis focused on the difference in SSVEP power for a 1-s time window after the onset of the outcome stimulus (3-4 s), in contrast to the 1-s presentation of the second picture of the sequence (1.5-2.5 s), subtracted as a baseline.","Subsequently, we averaged signal power at individual frequencies across occipital and parietal electrodes (O1, Oz, O2, P3, P4, Pz, P7, P8) for all statistical comparisons.","Throughout the stimulus presentation (0-4.5 s), theta and alpha SSVEPs were significantly above the prestimulus baseline level, both ts(37) &gt;

(2018) showed that the effect size of replications is on average about 50% of the original effect size, so we aimed for 90% power to detect an effect of half the original size (d = 0.29, i.e., 50% of 0.58; note that the preregistration incorrectly mentions 50% of d = 0.66, implying a lower minimum required sample size of 366).","Third, we tested whether the power of polygenic scores was greater for individuals who were reared with their biological relatives than for adoptees.","Notably, this polygenic-score analysis is better powered than the SNP heritability analysis, because it capitalizes on the power of the large discovery sample (N = 643,003).","We note that subsampling reduced the statistical power to detect differences within and between groups across time.","The difference between the variance explained in nonadopted individuals and adoptees suggests that about half of the predictive power of polygenic scores for educational attainment comes from passive gene-environment correlation.","Thus, the effects of passive gene-environment correlation may contribute even more than half of the predictive power of polygenic scores for education, as we estimated here.","However, highpowered preregistered studies (Garrison, Finley, &amp; Schmeichel, 2019;Hagger et al., 2016), meta-analyses (Carter, Kofler, Forster, &amp; McCullough, 2015), and theoretical reviews (Friese, Loschelder, Gieseler, Frankenbach, &amp; Inzlicht, 2019;Inzlicht &amp; Friese, 2019) suggest that laboratory depletion effects are small or potentially nonexistent and that previous work suffers from limitations such as ineffective experimental manipulations and low statistical power.","Second, we used a completely within-subjects design to reduce error variance and increase statistical power (Francis, Milyavskaya, Lin, &amp; Inzlicht, 2018).","We conducted sensitivity analyses using the Power Analysis for General ANOVA Designs program for the R Shiny app (Westfall, 2016), which suggested that roughly 130 participants would provide at least 80% statistical power to detect the hypothesized effect.","To reduce error variance and increase statistical power, we used within-subjects designs in all four studies.","Nevertheless, the small but meaningful effect size (reduced boundary effect: d = -0.15) suggests that researchers hoping to examine similar effects should use within-subjects designs to ensure sufficient statistical power, especially given that the boundary effect was present even after we accounted for within-subjects learning effects in our studies.","From Experiment 3 onward, sample size was determined so as to reach a power of .9 for the context effect observed in Experiment 2 on the basis of a simplified, no-pooling version of the logistic regression model (we fitted a logistic function for each of the participants on noncentered data and then tested the mean context coefficient against zero), t(23) = 2.82, p &lt; .01; Cohen's d = 0.58.","To determine our sample size for Experiment 1, we conducted an a priori power analysis with G*Power (Version 3.0; Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007).","This analysis revealed that 27 participants per cell would be required to detect a medium-sized effect of 25% difference between conditions with 95% power and a .05 criterion of statistical significance.","The parties were drawn from the same population of highly experienced MTurk workers, and they had similar power in the context of the experiments.","The original dimensions included Collectivism-Individualism, Power Distance, Femininity-Masculinity, and Uncertainty Avoidance.","Power Distance is the extent to which the less powerful members of organizations and institutions (such as the family) accept and expect that power is distributed unequally.","Hierarchy refers to unequal distribution of power, whereas egalitarianism refers to recognizing all people as moral equals.","The next most commonly used and cited cultural dimension is probably Power Distance, which has the second highest correlation with the American scale.","Societies with a larger power distance are more culturally distant to the United States.","However, sample sizes have varied considerably, and small but real age differences may have gone undetected because of low statistical power.","The study was highly powered and employed a CID-R task that evidence suggests is unaffected by explicit contamination.","Many prior studies have used inappropriately small sample sizes, and small effects may have gone undetected because of low statistical power.","Rather, variations in the magnitude of age differences are likely due to a combination of issues with power and task reliability.","The sample size was calculated on the basis of the expected effect size from a similar previous study (Aryani, Conrad, et al., 2018;

Faul et al., 2007).","The estimated sample size was 34 participants, but we used 36 to fit the counterbalancing (six conditions), which yielded a power estimate of .83.","Because we were interested in determining the effects of fixation position on interpretation, we used a medium effect size (d) of 0.6, an alpha of .004 ( Bonferroni corrected for the current study), and power of .8 for our sample-size computation (G*Power Version 3.1.9.2; Faul et al., 2007).","The estimated sample size was 33 participants, but to fit the counterbalancing, we recruited 48, which yielded a power estimate of .86.","In addition to inconsistent results, there are few standardized procedures, and sample sizes have been small (a mean of 23 per group in one meta-analysis; Brookwell et al., 2013), limiting power and potentially overestimating effect sizes (Button et al., 2013).","Our main aim was to collect as large a sample as possible at as many data-collection sites as possible, so decisions regarding sample size were not based purely on power analyses; we preregistered a minimum sample size of 420 for lab-based data collection (based on the anticipated number of data-collection sites) and 800 for online data collection (based on available funding).","Given only our anticipated lab-based sample, 420 participants would allow a power of .80 to detect a small effect size (r) of .12-although our aim was to collect substantially more than this number.","A wide range of findings has linked modulations of oscillatory power, phase, and frequency to various cognitive functions, such as attention, language, and memory (Wang, 2010).","The authors built on findings that increased theta power (~4-8 Hz) and decreased alpha power (~8-13 Hz) accompanies the processing of novelty, or \"unexpectedness,\" in the adult brain.","EEG spectral analysis provided partial support for a similar sensitivity of infant and adult brain rhythms to unexpected outcomes: Köster et al. reported a 4-Hz (infant theta) power increase in response to unexpected outcomes.","This effect mirrored the findings from adult EEG recordings, although no effect was found for 6-Hz (infant alpha) power.","Critically, this assumption underlay their interpretation of the bandlimited difference between the responses to expected and unexpected outcomes: Given that theta entrainment took place, the observed difference in oscillatory power must have reflected an effect on infant theta oscillations, in line with theta's postulated sensitivity to violations of expectations.","Here, we argue that both the assumption of entrainment in the first place and the consequent interpretation of band-limited power differences as modulations of entrained oscillations could be versions of the Fourier fallacy ( Jasper, 1948), that is, premature interpretations of frequency-domain effects in terms of oscillatory activity.","Additionally, impulse-like event-related potentials (ERPs) manifest as low-frequency EEG power transients, despite arising from signals that may or may not be related to neural oscillations (Herrmann et al., 2005).","At no point was the power of an \"oscillation\" manipulated.","Although our simulation did not involve modulating oscillatory (SSVEP) power, our results bear close qualitative similarity with the effects reported by Köster et al.","For unexpected outcomes, we observed a frequencyselective theta-power increase during theta stimulation but not alpha stimulation (Fig.","We then created time-frequency plots (averaged over the expected and unexpected conditions), as well as summary plots showing theta and alpha time courses separately for the expected-and unexpected-outcome conditions (baseline corrected as in the original study by subtracting the average power between 1.5 s and 2.5 s with respect to the onset of the flicker stimulus), as in Köster et al.","Most importantly, our model does not incorporate any modulation of band-limited theta (or alpha) power.","Köster et al. report a theta-power increase during 4-Hz stimulation (infant theta range), whereas a similar effect on theta power was absent during 6-Hz stimulation (alpha range) in a control analysis.","Second, note that the control result-the absence of a theta-power (4-Hz) increase during 6-Hz stimulation-stems from a special case.","In contrast to the two main analyses-theta power during theta-range stimulation and alpha power during alpha-range stimulationthe control analysis looks into one frequency range (theta) whereas the 6-Hz stimulation drives an SSVEP in the other (alpha).","The replication projects published thus far have undoubtedly succeeded in raising awareness of methodological shortcomings with regard to the power of research designs and the pitfalls of postdiction, culminating in the advent of Registered Reports (Nosek &amp; Lakens, 2014) and a widespread adoption of preregistration of research designs in psychology (Nosek &amp; Lindsay, 2018).","A single replication attempt, especially if insufficiently powered, provides only limited information about whether a prior research result is robust.","Participating research teams chose studies to replicate from a predefined sampling frame and subsequently conducted independent replication attempts \"using high-powered designs and original materials when available\" (Open Science Collaboration, 2015, abstract).","For example, a failed replication attempt might not be able to detect a true effect if it is itself underpowered, whereas a high-powered replication might uncover an effect that is orders of magnitude smaller than the original effect.","The \"small-telescopes\" approach of Simonsohn ( 2015) is based on the idea of detectability in that it tests whether the effect obtained in a replication study is smaller than an effect size that the original study had only 33% power to detect.","An obvious question is whether my inability to reject the null hypothesis is the result of the study being inadequately powered.","On the basis of the estimated standard errors in the main specification, I had 80% power to detect an effect of around 0.2 in IHS units for successful replications and around 0.18 IHS units for failed replications at an α of .05, corresponding to 0.19 and 0.17 standard deviations, respectively.","This issue is particularly important because the power calculations underlying the RP:P replications were based on the original effect sizes.","In the presence of a type-M error (Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014), this practice is likely to result in replication attempts that are themselves not sufficiently powered to detect the effects of interest and hence could render some of the evidence too weak to shift researchers' beliefs.","With that sample size, the minimum detectable effect size with statistical power at the recommended .80 level was a Cohen's d of 0.32 for mean comparisons between participants who received a good signal and participants who received a bad signal and a Cohen's d of 0.46 for mean comparisons between the four possible combinations of signals (Cohen, 1988).","In the current work, we applied the boosting approach to empower individuals holding misperceptions to understand the value of and to identify scientific consensus.","Communicating scientific consensus, paired with science-communication campaigns focused on boosting understanding and identification of scientific consensus, is a promising place to start. boosting consensus reasoning is intended to empower individuals to make the best use of already available information.","This smaller sample was enough to detect a medium effect size (η p 2 = .066) with .90 power and an α of .05 for Hypothesis 2 (Faul et al., 2009).","One explanation for these tentative findings could be a lack of power.","We addressed this issue in Experiment 3 by conducting a high-powered replication.","The follow-up measure was dropped in order to reserve all our resources for testing the immediate effects with high power.","Instead, we conducted an a priori power analysis based on the comparison between the boost+ and consensus-only conditions of Experiment 2 (see the Supplemental Material; final N = 854, 65.81% female, mean age = 35.90 years, SD = 12.92).","In the case of climate change, we found moderate evidence against the effectiveness of an extensive boost (the boost+ condition) to correct a misperception (BF 10 = 0.18; increase in belief in true statement: d = 0.04), whereas a high-powered experiment about genetically engineered food yielded extreme evidence in favor of boosting consensus reasoning to aid participants to come to an accurate belief (BF 10 = 309.98; decrease in belief in false statement: d = -0.35).","Finally, it could be that we did not have enough statistical power in the climate-change experiment to find a true difference between the boost+ and the consensus-only conditions.","Even if a true effect existed in our sample of climate-change deniers similar in size to the one we found in Experiment 3 about genetically engineered food, then the experiment about climate change was underpowered (achieved power ~55%).","Second, there is an ethical advantage to boosting people's understanding of consensus over only communicating the consensus, namely that its goal is to empower individuals (Hertwig &amp; Grüne-Yanoff, 2017).","Conversely, boosting is meant not to persuade but to empower individuals to be able to understand and make the best use of the available information regarding a scientific consensus, whether that consensus is in line with their preferred beliefs or not.","We are hesitant in interpreting this result because the second experiment appeared to be underpowered to detect an effect of the boost+ condition compared with the consensus-only condition, especially at follow-up.","Ninety subjects participated in three experiments for payment or course credit: 20 participants in Experiment 1 (14 female; age: M = 24.35 years, SD = 3.88; all right handed; sample size in this more exploratory experiment was chosen on the basis of a common practice for exploratory experiments in our laboratory), 20 participants in Experiment 2 (13 female; age: M = 23.35 years, SD = 1.77; all right handed; sample size was selected on the basis of a power analysis on the effect from Experiment 1; see preregistration at [https://osf .io/wa8g6/](https://osf.io/wa8g6/)), and 50 participants in Experiment 3 (29 female; age: M = 24.76 years, SD = 3.48; 47 right handed; sample size was defined by multiplying the sample size of Experiment 2 by 2.5; see Simonsohn, 2015).","Fifteen of the 16 studies were preregistered; all preregistrations describe power analyses guiding our sample sizes, detailed methods, and analysis plans.","This yielded both power and phase values of 18 frequency bins from 0 Hz to 20.6 Hz.","To statistically assess the presence or absence of a significant temporal pattern in our hit-rate time course (i.e., peaks in its power spectrum), we applied a nonparametric resampling procedure.","This created a distribution of 10,000 power values for each frequency bin, from which we determined the statistical thresholds (p = .005; i.e., Bonferroni corrected for tests in 10 frequency bins).","For significant peaks in the power spectrum, determined as described above, we compared the corresponding phase angles between the TMT A and TMT B conditions using a parametric Watson-Williams two-sample test (Berens, 2009).","Specifically, 6-Hz fluctuations for TMT A trials timelocked to template A were significantly larger than the power observed in our distribution of surrogate data (Fig. 4 we observed a significant peak at 9.7 Hz for TMT B trials if time-locked to template B (p &lt; .001, d = 0.39).","Note, however, that it is also possible that the permutation approach we applied lacked the statistical power to detect peaks in both conditions.","However, observed patterns have been partly contradictory and have limited discriminative power (DePaulo et al., 2003).","Too many variables may lead to overfitting and poor out-of-sample prediction power.","However, to ensure that our study would have sufficient power to detect a possible mediation effect, we used the mc_ power_med app (Schoemann et al., 2017) to calculate sample-size requirements for a basic mediation analysis.","Assuming the smallest effect size of interest (r = .3) between each of the pathways (a, b, and c′), we estimated that a total sample size of 240 participants would provide power of .95 to detect a significant mediation effect with an α of .05.","We aimed to achieve power of .95 (rather than the field standard of .8) to allow for potential increases in residual errors arising from online data collection and to increase our power to detect other potential effects (e.g., moderation) in the analyses.","Statistical power","Given our sample size of 50 per group, with 18 repetitions per observation in our primary task, we had approximately 90% power to detect three-way interactions with a small effect size (Cohen's d = 0.2).","This sample size, reflecting the number of participants we successfully managed to recruit across a fixed-duration recruitment period of 2 months, provided high power (&gt; 99.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [99.6, 100.0]) to detect an estimated medium-size effect for the fixed effect of self-reported personality traits in the linear mixed-effects model.","This test was chosen for the power analysis because it directly assessed the central hypothesis, namely, that beliefs about oneself (in this case, beliefs about one's personality traits) would be related to corresponding visual features of the self-portrait.","Power calculations were based on Monte Carlo simulations using the simr package (Version 1.0.5;

Version 3.6.1.","; R Core Team, 2019; see Champely, 2020) indicated that a sample of 21 participants per group would be needed to obtain statistical power at a 0.80 level (α = .05) to detect a small-to-medium difference among conditions (d = 0.37 or f = 0.185).","We note that this analysis has greater power than our analysis of efficiency in training because there were more dyslexia participants using the optimal strategy in the information-integration task during the test (information integration-dyslexia: N = 9, control: N = 17; rule based-dyslexia: N = 16, control: N = 16).","Because of our previous encounters with laptops, we have learned which parts of the laptop are most likely to contain the power button.","We chose to collect 80 data sets for each experiment after replacement of outliers (see below) on the basis of an a priori power analysis (α = .05, power = .85) using G*Power (Version 3.1;Faul et al., 2007), which yielded a projected sample size of 76 for the simplest within-group comparison in a study with a small to medium effect size (d = 0.35).","An optimal sample size of 28 participants was determined a priori using G*Power software (Faul et al., 2007) with 80% power to detect small to medium effects (Cohen's f = 0.14) of food deprivation on self-reported measures of stress and mood (MacCormack &amp; Lindquist, 2019) with .05 α error probability and correlation among repeated measures of .5.","Sensitivity analysis showed that expected sample size (~11.5% of the full sample, i.e., 109 participants) would provide us with 80% power for determining medium effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.6) for the main effects and small effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.2) for interactions.","To reach a statistical power adequate to detect minor","The consequent lack of statistical power may thus be one of the sources of the nonrandom variance observed in Seblova et al.'s (2020) meta-analysis.","Pivotal to the aims of this study, we (a) employed data that met the requirements for statistical power and (b) incorporated both gc and gf measures in a single model to account for their shared variance.","The semPower R package (Moshagen &amp; Erdfelder, 2016) was employed for power analysis.","Power analysis.","A post hoc power analysis was run.","A sample size of 1,892 was associated with nearly 100% power to reject an incorrect model (amount of misspecification set at root-mean-square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.050, α = .005).","Overall, these results confirmed that the model possessed enough statistical power to reliably detect small longitudinal changes.","Crucially, these null findings are hardly attributable to low statistical power.","Using G*Power (Faul et al., 2007), we predetermined that a sample size of 150 would be necessary to detect a medium-size between-subjects effect with an α of .05 and a statistical power of .80 in a mixed ANOVA for Studies 1 and 2.","We predetermined that a sample size of 60 would be needed to detect a medium-size effect with an α of .05 and a statistical power of .80 in a logistic regression.","We ran a priori power analyses to estimate the appropriate sample size for a bivariate correlation (Hypothesis 1 vs. 1 alt ) based on the correlation (r = .24) observed by Wood et al.","Detecting a correlation of .24 with 80% power would require at least 133 participants who do not believe the official version of events.","This sample size also provided 80% power for the Fisher's r-to-z tests (Hypothesis 2) to detect an effect size below medium (q = .269) in the case of highly skewed distributions (e.g., at least 133 participants disbelieve and 667 believe the official version); for more even distributions (e.g., 400 believers and 400 disbelievers), this sample size provided 80% power to detect even smaller effect sizes (q = .199).","The target sample of our power analysis (at least 133 participants who disbelieved the official version of events) was reached for seven out of eight topics.","A total of 5,261 participants responded to the questionnaire containing the measures for the present project (2,942 men, 2,319 women;

Douglas, 2022).","The sample sizes and power calculation were based on our previous knowledge and experience with similar experimental models and anticipated biological variables.","The advantage of polygenic scores is that they can be used to index relevant genetic factors in samples of unrelated individuals by leveraging the statistical power of meta-analysis results from large genome-wide association studies (GWASs).","Training and testing polygenic scores in different ancestry groups has been shown to reduce predictive power (Carlson et al., 2013;Duncan et al., 2019;Martin et al., 2017).","At this level of simulated noise, we estimated 100% power (α = .05) to detect a stronger IPS association with crystallized performance than with fluid performance.","Because of broad ancestral diversity in the ABCD cohort, there was limited power for comparing the effects in different ancestry groups.","Participants contributed on average 2.33 observations for subjective age (range 1-7), resulting in an overall number of observations amounting to 34,792, which should correspond to sufficient statistical power to detect small to medium effect sizes.","This might have implications for the estimates of trajectories and for statistical power.","This sample size provided approximately 80% power to detect a moderate to large effect size (ds = 0.5-0.7) and is consistent with or larger than sample sizes used in previous experiments on children's metaphor comprehension (e.g., Zhu et al., 2020, in press).","The sample size was determined by an a priori power calculation for a dependent-samples t test (based on the difference in mean avoidance behavior between conditions during the test of generalization; G*Power, Faul et al., 2009; α = .05, power = .80, d = 0.50), which yielded a minimum sample size of 34.","Because of the novelty of the paradigm and research question, we chose a moderate effect size for determining the power of the study.","We posted recruitment flyers in each university with a goal of attaining 90% statistical power to detect the average effect size (d = 0.43) in social psychology (Richard et al., 2003).","The final sample had 97% statistical power for this effect size.","We targeted a sample size of 117 applicants, based on a medium effect size (φ = 0.3) and 90% power.","To estimate the sample size, we ran a small pretest on Prolific and used the smallest effect size (d = 0.56) to estimate the sample size needed for 90% statistical power (N = 204).","We compare the predictive power of measuring water using water resources per capita, water resources per land area, and precipitation (Table S3 in the Supplemental Material).","Our power analysis indicated that we would require 191 participants to detect an effect of small to medium size ( J.","We treated this as a minimum and recruited 500 participants to ensure that our study was appropriately powered and to account for potential exclusions.","As discussed in Study 3, our power calculation suggested that detecting a small to medium effect required approximately 200 participants.","We used the same power calculation as in Study 4a.","Given that Studies 4a and 4b revealed a smaller effect size than Study 3, we performed a new power analysis in G*Power (Faul et al., 2009), averaging the effect sizes from Studies 3, 4a, and 4b, which indicated that a two-condition study required 779 participants for 80% power.","We used the same power analysis as in Study 5a.","Because the size of encoding-speed adaptations is unknown, we could not base our sample size on formal power calculations.","The power analyses used to determine the necessary sample sizes are described in the Supplemental Material available online.","Fifteen healthy infants between 184 and 261 days old (M = 220.40 days, SD = 20.17;

a post hoc power analysis for a one-sample t-test with a sample size of 199 and an α of .05 revealed that we had 80% power to detect an effect of at least d = 0.2.","An a priori power analysis using effect sizes from a previous investigation (He &amp;

e.g., Blalock, 2015).","First, analyses in this study were from a substudy trial and were underpowered, precluding a primary focus on the role of intervention in driving the parenting and cumulative risk interaction.","The study was conducted at a time when detailed power analyses were uncommon (2014), so sample size was only determined to clearly exceed the size of standard selective-exposure experiments reported in the literature.","Because the study was conducted at a time when power analyses were quite uncommon (2015), sample sizes were determined by budgetary considerations only.","Basis for the power analysis of the predicted interaction of conditions (control, friendly climate, oppositional climate) and conflict in Study 3 was a mixed-model simulation with data from Study 2.","The results showed that 180 participants are sufficient to achieve a power of 92.25%.","As the preregistered analyses had power issues (relatively large dropout due to imprecise exclusion criteria; see the Participants and Design section), we repeated all analyses by applying only two out of three exclusion criteria as a robustness check.","Fourth and most crucially, by modern standards the studies had some power issues.","The sample size was determined on the basis of a power analysis that indicated 90 participants would be sufficient to achieve 80% power and a medium effect size.","To estimate the required sample size, we ran a power analysis using the simr package in R (Green &amp; MacLeod, 2016).","Therefore, we ran the power analysis using 10 time points per participant.","Our analysis indicated that 400 participants would be sufficient to detect such an effect with 99.10% power, 95% CI = [98.30, 99.59] (see the Supplemental Material for additional details on the power analysis).","We report all measures and exclusions (see Supplemental File S2), along with power analyses justifying our sample sizes (see Supplemental File S3).","Power analyses","G*Power was used for the a priori power analysis (Faul et al., 2007).","To detect an effect of the size of the lower bound of the smaller (and more relevant) effect on recognition accuracy, we needed a d z of 0.34, with 95% power required for a total sample size of 115 (two-tailed test).","This resulted in a total sample size of 230 for the replication study, equipping each of the direct replication conditions (no announcement for the Ackerman stimuli) with 95% power to detect an effect at the lower bound of the 95% CI of the original Ackerman findings.","However, to be able to account for possible publication bias and to guarantee that our study was not underpowered, we decided to collect a total of 400 participants for this replication.","For the central effect size, the double difference score of (White neutral -Black neutral) versus (White angry -Black angry), a sample size of 400 participants equipped us with 90% power to find evidence for equivalence in the critical smallest effect size of interest window from d z = -0.165 to d z = 0.165.","We estimated the sample size required for a between-subjects design with three conditions (mindful-gratitude practice, mindful-attention practice, and control) and a continuous moderator (collective narcissism) for an alpha level of .05 and power of .80.","Our estimation produced a sample size of 432 (G*Power 3.1;

Faul et al., 2009) analy sis using pilot data from 20 participants for a Bonferroni-corrected (for two comparisons) one-sample t test (d = 0.45, α = .05, p = .95) determined that we should recruit 67 participants.","However, given the Bonferroni corrections, the study is underpowered to determine whether the difference between explicit and implicit attention is driven by a relative increase in ratings for synchronous trials or a relative decrease in ratings for asynchronous trials; thus, this finding should be interpreted with caution.","We used the same stopping rule as in Experiment 1a; we did not carry out a separate G*Power analysis for this experiment but rather used the same power calculation as in Experiment 1a to determine our sample size.","Also, with such statistical power, it can be assumed that the additional analyses that were undertaken would have provided evidence for the alternative hypothesis, if it had been well founded.","All sample sizes were set a priori and were sufficient to detect a small interaction ( f 2 = 0.06) with 80% power.","This threshold was set on the basis of a pilot experiment that revealed a small interaction ( f 2 = 0.06, 95% confidence interval, or CI = [0.02, 0.12]) and a subsequent power analysis that suggested that at least 47 participants per cell would be required to detect it.","Given that all simple effects of frame (e.g., prevent vs. fix) within the punishment and reward conditions in Experiments 1 through 4 were significant (and in opposite directions), we tested punishments and rewards separately in Experiments 5a and 5b to maximize statistical power.","These studies have demonstrated correlations between HRV fluctuations and EEG power, particularly in the delta band (1-4 Hz).","Autoregressive modeling was then performed for each IBI time series using Kubios software (Niskanen et al., 2004) to identify a peak in the power spectrum in the HF-HRV range (0.15-0.4 Hz) for each participant, which was subsequently used to extract sinusoidal variation in heart rate (HF-HRV) at the participant's most prominent frequency.","Deviations from a uniform distribution were quantified with the MI, with higher values (ranging between 0 and 1) indicating systematic variance in EEG power over HF-HRV phase bins and, therefore, reflecting PAC.","We submitted each subject's EEG power spectrum to specparam (Donoghue et al., 2020;Ostlund et al., 2022) to remove aperiodic (1/f ) activity and identify oscillatory peaks in the residualized power spectrum.","Several previous studies have employed Granger causality or similar methods to examine directional interactions between EEG and heart rate, raw EKG, or HRV power time series.","However, one study showed that HF-HRV power changes preceded changes in the delta band during sleep ( Jurysta et al., 2003), and another showed stronger heart-to-brain interactions during an emotion elicitation paradigm (Candia-Rivera et al., 2022).","For Experiment 1, we aimed for a convenience sample of 600 participants to ensure sufficient statistical power (α &gt; .90) to detect small-to-medium-sized interaction effects in the present design (Cohen, 1992; see Text S5 in the Supplemental Material).","To provide sufficient statistical power (α &gt; .90) to detect small-to-medium-sized interaction effects in the present design (Cohen, 1992), we aimed for a convenience sample of 300 participants (see Text S5 in the Supplemental Material).","To provide sufficient statistical power (α &gt; .90) to detect small-to-medium-sized effects in the present design (Cohen, 1992), we aimed for a convenience sample of 500 participants.","For Experiments 4a and 4b, we each aimed for a convenience sample of 600 participants to ensure sufficient statistical power (α &gt; .90) to detect small-to-mediumsized effects in the respective experiment designs (Cohen, 1992).","Furthermore, we examined four types of network homophily that, despite representing different intergroup relationships (e.g., in terms of power or type of contact) yielded the same results for this indirect effect.","Here, to assure a wellpowered design, we took advantage of our online design to double the target sample size.","A post hoc power analysis confirmed that we had a power of 0.84 to detect a medium effect.","We did not base our target sample size on formal power analyses, partly because we had very different predictions for the effects of ValenceDiff and Frame.","It did not seem reasonable to chase power for an effect size near zero.","Nonetheless, subsequent simulation-based power analyses (Kumle et al., 2021) that were not based in any way on our observed data indicated that we had substantial power for detecting very small (d = 0.10) or small (d = 0.20) effects in our primary model for predicting participants' choices (see the Supplemental Material).","With 900 participants (our target), power was .999 for a very small effect of ValenceDiff and .96 for a small residual effect of Frame.","With 500 participants (slightly fewer than in our student sample), power was .97 for a very small effect of ValenceDiff and .81 for a small effect of Frame.","Obtaining power greater than .80 for a very small effect of Frame would have required more than 2,000 participants.","For tests involving only two of the 18 cells, power was lower but still acceptable in many cases.","For the standard framing effect (L6-G4, target n = 90), power was .94 for the Many Labs effect size (d = 0.60; Klein et al., 2014) and .84 for a medium effect (d = 0.50).","Obviously, power estimates for tests involving such small subsets of the data are less important than those for the primary analysis.","Hostile sexism comprises overtly negative beliefs, characterizing women as manipulative, power-hungry, and oversensitive.","directly enforces norms of men's power (Bareket &amp; Fiske, 2023), fostering discrimination against powerful women (Masser &amp; Abrams, 2004) and opposition to genderbased policies (Hideg &amp; Ferris, 2013).","In contrast, the patronizing content of benevolent sexism indirectly enforces men's power through gender-role norms (Bareket &amp; Fiske, 2023), undermining women's career aspirations (Kuchynka et al., 2017) and willingness to challenge gender inequality (Becker &amp; Wright, 2011;Hammond &amp; Sibley, 2011).","Benevolent sexism is theorized to facilitate intimacy, whereas hostile sexism maintains men's power.","However, this power dynamic allows the punitive effects of benevolent to manifest within such relationships.","For example, benevolent sexism promotes women's acceptance of their partner's autocratic behavior (Moya et al., 2007) and predicts beliefs that normalize men's power over their partners (Chen et al., 2009).","In addition to testing these two opposing associations, we also assessed hostile sexism, which we expected to be positively related to tolerance of both outsider and spousal violence, consistent with its overt enforcement of men's power (Bareket &amp; Fiske, 2023).","The three items measuring hostile sexism were \"Women are too easily offended,\" \"Women seek to gain power by controlling men,\" and \"In a fair competition, if women lose to men, they usually complain about being discriminated against.\"","We did not conduct an a priori power analysis.","Because of the extremely large sample size, we determined that there was adequate power to detect the hypothesized effects, and we selected a more conservative critical alpha of p = .01.","As expected, hostile sexism was related to greater tolerance of both outsider violence and spousal violence (see Agadullina et al., 2022), consistent with its function of directly enforcing men's power (Bareket &amp; Fiske, 2023).","Our results provide new evidence for a central proposition of ambivalent sexism theory: Hostile and benevolent sexism have distinct consequences that perpetuate men's societal power.","Hostile sexism reinforces such power with overt aggression.","Although the disempowering effects of benevolent sexism are well documented, the implications for women's power within relationships are underresearched (Hammond &amp; Overall, 2017).","It can legitimize men's power over women directly-at least within the traditional relationships that are prevalent in non-WEIRD societies such as India.","High statistical power also meant that our estimates of the hypothesized associations were very precise.","Our team of coders was not large enough to code, by hand, a quarter million tweets, so we took steps to identify a subset that was more feasible for our coders, with the additional goal of maximizing their hit rates for engaging and dismissing tweets, which in turn would maximize the power of our analyses.","This provided 80% power to detect differences between engaging and dismissing-d = 0.38 (Study 1a) and d = 0.47 (Study 1b).","Study 2a participants provided two observations, and 2b participants six; in each case we targeted 1,200 total observations (preregistration links noted in the open practices section provide a priori power analyses justifying this sample size).","We initially targeted 240 participants-160 representing the majority who rarely or never react to politicians' tweets, and 80 of the more unusual participants who frequently do so (for a priori power analyses justifying this sample size, see the preregistration).","Sensitivity analyses indicated we had over 95% power to detect even small effects (d = 0.22).","The modest sample size in our experiments might not guarantee adequate power for relating the magnitude of the effect of statistical learning on conscious access to individual participants' awareness of the regularities (Vadillo et al., 2020).","As mentioned above, the results here provide only weak evidence for the level of awareness of the regularity of the participants and need to be interpreted with caution because of the limitations of the methods (e.g., lack of statistical power).","Again, these findings provide only weak evidence for the absence of a relation between awareness of the regularity and conscious access, and they should be approached with caution because of the methodological constraints (e.g., lack of statistical power).","After reviewing the effect size (Cohen's d = 0.34) of a previous study that used the bias-free b-CFS paradigm to measure conscious access (Litwin et al., 2023), we concluded that a sample of 55 participants was needed for an experimental power of 80% with an alpha level of 0.05 for a planned one-tailed paired-samples t test (power calculation performed in G*Power).","Our power analysis indicated that a sample of 42 participants per age group would provide 80% power to detect differences in group means (α = .05).","However, the achieved sample is still powered (77%) to detect a medium-sized effect (0.55), so we moved our stopping rule to 35 (our obtained sample) prior to data analysis.","This power analysis indicated that a sample size of 60 participants per age group would allow for at least 80% power to detect group differences at the standard alpha error probability of .05; however, we did not reach our full child-sample goal because of COVID-19.","The sample size for Experiment 2 was selected according to a simulation-based bootstrap power analysis so as to give in excess of 95% power to detect a betweenparticipants effect size estimated from permuted data from Experiment 1 (estimated between-participants Cohen's d = 0.63).","For the triangle-completion task, we generated 1,000 data sets for the turn angle and distance using either planar or spherical geometry prediction using the Mixedpower R package (Kreidler et al., 2021;Kumle et al., 2021).","With a sample size of 20, the power was 100%."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>id<\/th>\n      <th>text<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":5,"dom":"tip","columnDefs":[{"name":"id","targets":0},{"name":"text","targets":1}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[5,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

(2015) included measures of rapid automatized naming (RAN), which is known to be a powerful predictor of the development of word-reading skills (Caravolas, Lervåg, Defior, Seidlová Málková, &amp; Hulme, 2013;Caravolas et al., 2012;Lervåg et al., 2009).","However, the findings provide powerful society-level evidence that is in line with past experimental or opportunity sample research showing that, after contextual threats, liberals shift toward conservative positions (e.g., Nail et al., 2009;van der Toorn et al., 2014).","This approach integrates insights from ultimate (evolutionary) and proximate (decision-making) levels of analysis and, in doing so, provides evidence for a powerful process underlying diverse forms of decision making.","Fourth, confirmatory studies, or core studies in a research line, should be sufficiently powerful and preregistered (Asendorpf et al., 2013;Wagenmakers et al., 2012).","Linguistic body descriptors are compact but can operate as powerful perceptual discriminators.","Contingency is a powerful driver of motivation (see Deci, Koestner, &amp; Ryan, 1999, for a review), and at first glance, it might seem wasteful to improve performance when rewards do not depend on performance (Lepper &amp; Greene, 1978).","This finding is in line with two prior studies on molecular genetic correlates of educational attainment that relied on a less powerful GPS: Conley et al. (2015) found evidence of genetic transmission in parent-child educational correlations, and Domingue et al. (2015) found that participants with higher polygenic scores were more likely to grow up in socially advantaged families.","Instructed rules have powerful effects on behavior when they are implemented or maintained for future use (Meiran, Liefooghe, &amp; De Houwer, 2017).","Furthermore, we propose that the next paradigm might be a useful tool to study structuring and implementation of instructions in different age groups and, more generally, the powerful effects that instructions and intentions can have on behavior.","There, the relationship-context effect was not significant, probably because these analyses were less powerful than our other analyses.","However, it remains largely unclear why implicit partner evaluations have such a powerful predicting influence on long-term outcomes.","Consequently, we argue that positive implicit partner evaluations may be especially powerful predictors of positive relationships' long-term outcomes because they regularly promote more constructive nonverbal behavior in daily life.","Because one unique aspect of romantic dyads is that partners are very spontaneous toward each other (Collins &amp; Feeney, 2000), nonverbal behavior stands out as a powerful interpersonal process through which implicit partner evaluations exert their influences on relational outcomes over time.","Psychological science can be a powerful tool for quantifying the association between screen use and adolescent well-being, yet it routinely fails to supply the robust, objective, and replicable evidence necessary to support its hypotheses.","Classical fear conditioning provides a powerful model to explain the acquisition of fear in humans and nonhuman animals (LeDoux, 2014) and is often used to explain the development of anxiety disorders (Lissek et al., 2005;Mineka &amp; Oehlberg, 2008).","In both countries, the change in event expectation induced by the election itself had a powerful effect on production and comprehension.","But this article reports a previously undocumented powerful bias affecting linguistic behavior: When people refer to the next head of government, even when the set of candidates has been narrowed down to two, they disprefer she references relative to expectations regarding the referent's gender.","Third, polygenic scores, which index the genetic liability that each individual carries for a specific trait, are notably powerful for educational attainment and now predict approximately 10% of the variation in years of education (Lee et al., 2018), a finding with potential social implications (Plomin &amp; von Stumm, 2018).","By showing that polygenic scores for education are twice as powerful in nonadopted individuals compared with adoptees, we suggest that genetic influence on educational attainment is magnified when individuals are reared by their close genetic relatives, with whom they share both genes and environments.","For example, conducting studies to test generalizability or explain anticipated cultural variation from U.S. studies will be less powerful if done in Australia compared with Yemen, but generalizing a study conducted in Turkey will be less powerful if done in Yemen compared with Australia.","Evidently, the person-culture match effect can be much more powerful than previously thought (Diener et al., 2011;Gebauer et al., 2017;Stavrova, Fetchenhauer, &amp; Schlösser, 2013).","This, again, illustrates that the person-culture match effect can be much more powerful than previously thought.","But how powerful was that moderation?","How powerful was personality as a moderator of the person-culture match effect?","Two tests suggested that personality was powerful.","Thus, opportunities to learn about oneself and the actual and counterfactual consequences of one's decisions may have powerful motivational status.","Manipulations of agency have powerful effects on people's emotional evaluation of events (Coricelli et al., 2005), so it is intuitive that a sense of agency would also increase curiosity about outcomes and forgone alternatives of the past events.","While mortality represents a powerful ending, geographical relocations, college graduations, and political events that prime the fragility of life (e.g., terrorist attacks) also result in the prioritization of emotionally meaningful goals (Fredrickson &amp; Carstensen, 1990;Fung &amp; Carstensen, 2004).","Physiological monitoring was conducted through a Powerlab (AD-Instru ments, Sydney, Australia).","Hallucinations are often associated with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (Bauer et al., 2011) or other psychiatric disorders (Toh et al., 2016), but they can also occur in people who have not been diagnosed at all (Powers et al., 2017;Sommer et al., 2010).","This finding held across both primary and secondary assessments of hallucinatory experiences and, in combination with results of previous studies, can be taken to support theoretical arguments regarding overweighted top-down processes in hallucinatory experiences (Powers et al., 2016).","In addition, individuals with hallucinations of similar intensity to patients but without apparent distress or disability (e.g., the nonclinical hallucinators reported by Powers et al., 2017, andSommer et al., 2010) have been an important comparison group.","Simulation is a powerful tool; it allows full control over the input to the spectral analysis, so we can test our intuitions about what groundtruth mechanism could have generated a given pattern of results.","Moreover, the current work extends existing research by demonstrating that empowering people to understand and iden tify scientific consensus can help to correct a false belief even further, as is demonstrated in the case of genetically engineered food.","This empowerment, combined with exposure to information about a scientific consensus embedded in a naturalistic environment, might also yield less resistance than more direct means of persuasion, because direct means of persuasion may be perceived as deceiving or as a threat to freedom (Fransen et al., 2015).","Boosting consensus reasoning empowers individuals to identify misinformation in the form of a false consensus by looking at the source of the consensus claim and the expertise of the individuals making up the consensus.","To conclude, the current work extends existing research by demonstrating that empowering individuals who hold misperceptions to use scientific consensus in deciding whether or not something is true can help to correct these false beliefs.","Our results suggest that this intuition is incorrect, but even incorrect intuitions can powerfully shape behavior (Prentice &amp; Miller, 1993).","The total mooddisturbance score has been shown to have good psychometric properties, including high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .96) and powerful convergent validity for both positive and negative affect; rs range from .57 to .84 for POMS subscales making up the total mood-disturbance score (Heuchert &amp; McNair, 2012).","First impressions are powerfully influenced by faces.","To test these predictions, we examined two large, diverse U.S. samples across 10 waves of longitudinal data during the COVID-19 pandemic-a powerful threat to both physical and mental health.","Because reappraisal involves changing one's perspective on the nature of the threat one is facing (Uusberg et al., 2019), it can powerfully shape people's emotional experiences.","Emotion regulation is clearly a powerful tool and as such must be wielded with caution and knowledge of both its benefits and its costs.","Although widespread stigmatizing narratives framing refugees as inherently weak, deficient victims may limit refugees' ability to make use of the measures, we hypothesize that it is possible to reframe refugees' identity in an empowering way that will allow them to make better use of these opportunities.","Yet with the assumption that it is not the refugee identity per se but the narrative attached to it that causes this harm, we theorized that reframing refugees' identity in an empowering way could help them succeed.","Empowerment in individuals' self-presentation.","Two coders unaware of the conditions participants were assigned to rated how motivated (1 = not at all motivated, 5 = very motivated; intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = .78) and agentic (1 = not at all agentic, 5 = very agentic; ICC = .73) each student seemed to be, how empowering their response was (1 = not at all empowering, 5 = very empowering; ICC = .93), and how likely they thought the student was to succeed at the university (1 = very unlikely, 5 = very likely; ICC = .77).","Responses were rated as more motivated, more agentic, more empowering, and indicating a higher likelihood of success at university in the intervention condition than in the study-skills control condition.","Touch is a powerful communication tool, but we have a limited understanding of the role played by particular physical features of interpersonal touch communication.","These results suggest that disagreement, often highlighted for its negative impact, is a powerful tool in producing accurate judgments.","With such a powerful tool available to individuals, a key challenge is to identify strategies that can help improve the accuracy of people's aggregate estimates (Herzog &amp; Hertwig, 2014a).","By utilizing people's ability to take the perspective of others, we propose that disagreement is a powerful tool for producing accurate estimates.","It does not mislead or covertly change behavior; it empowers the public by providing valuable information that can support informed decision making.","This finding extends the work of Brescoll (2011) examining powerful women's moderation of speaking time by showing gender differences even among junior scholars for whom, presumably, egalitarian beliefs are especially strong.","Time pressure is a powerful experimental manipulation frequently used to arbitrate between competing dual-process models of prosocial decision-making, which typically assume that automatic responses yield to deliberation over time.","These convergent findings are powerful, but whether fixated and peripheral information shape behavior similarly remains an open question.","The ECG signal was recorded at 1000 HZ (band-pass filtered between 0.3 and 1000 Hz) with a PowerLab 8/35 data acquisition device (ADInstruments, [http://www.adinstru ments.com/](http://www.adinstruments.com/)) using LabChart 8 Pro software (ADInstruments).","Examining changes in consistency of person-centered ratings over time provides a powerful-and, we believe, novel-tool for evaluating changes in face learning with experience, decoupled from the similarity between the images used to train and test for familiarization.","Art engagement has deep roots in human ontogeny and powerful effects on children's emotions.","One may have predicted that EAPS would have been a more powerful predictor of cognitive measures in ABCD than IPS because it had more than 4 times the discovery sample size.","Consequently, metaphors may be a powerful learning mechanism from early childhood onward.","Researchers across multiple domains of cognitive science have previously argued that metaphors are a powerful source of innovation and conceptual change in adults.","If preschoolers can make new inferences from metaphors, this may suggest that metaphors are a powerful learning mechanism early in ontogenesis.","Moreover, metaphors may be a powerful cognitive tool that helps both adults and young children learn about the world around them. ones they might hear in naturalistic contexts (i.e., metaphors are often presented alone rather than contrasted with other metaphors).","Moreover, by demonstrating that preschoolers can make additional inferences from novel metaphors, the present research suggests that metaphors may be a powerful learning mechanism that could allow children to acquire new information.","Interestingly, because metaphors frequently provide a new perspective (Camp, 2006(Camp,, 2009) ) without necessarily providing new information, they may be a powerful case of \"learning by thinking,\" allowing for the acquisition of new knowledge and concepts with little or no additional data (Lombrozo, 2019;Xu, 2019).","Force refers to the \"use of excessive or unnecessary force\" (e.g., punching or deadly force), abuse of authority refers to \"abuse of police powers to intimidate or mistreat a civilian\" (e.g., improper stop and frisk), discourtesy refers to \"cursing and using other foul language or gestures,\" and offensive language refers to \"slurs or derogatory remarks or gestures based upon race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or physical disability\" (CCRB, 2023a).","Because we hypothesized a \"knock-out\" interaction, we followed recent recommendations (Anderson et al., 2017) for powering an interaction effect and quadrupled our sample size from Studies 5a and 5b (Giner-Sorolla, 2018), aiming to recruit 3,300 participants on MTurk.","Moreover, we followed recent recommendations for sampling and powering interaction effects (Giner-Sorolla, 2018), providing strong confidence in our findings.","Given these commonalities, it seems that these formal models of adaptive dynamics (e.g., Glaze et al., 2015) could be a powerful way to conceptualize encoding-speed adaptations in working memory.","Note that the powersim function in simR allows only two-tailed tests, whereas our preregistered analysis for this effect specified a one-tailed test.","Exploring memory phenomenology in therapeutic techniques such as emotion regulation (e.g., Webb et al., 2012) and resolving past experiences (i.e., \"closure\"; see Crawley, 2010) will be important to consider in light of the present findings and clinical work implicating mental imagery as a powerful therapeutic tool (Blackwell, 2019;Hackmann &amp; Holmes, 2004).","Accordingly, interventions targeting sensitive and responsive caregiving during early childhood may be a powerful way to support caregivers in mitigating biological consequences of stress across development.","Accordingly, intervention during this developmental period may be particularly powerful in attenuating the impact of adversity exposure on epigenetic aging, which has not yet been tested.","Poweranalysis simulations are available at [https://osf.io/rx3e6/](https://osf.io/rx3e6/).","Although selective attention is a powerful tool for reducing the complexity of the information to which we are exposed, inattentional blindness can also have serious consequences during driving (e.g., Strayer &amp; Drews, 2007;Strayer et al., 2003;Strayer &amp; Johnston, 2001) or medical-image perception (Trueblood et al., 2021;e.g., Tuddenham, 1962).","Prior studies have shown that self-control is a particularly powerful predictor of adult health, wealth, and crime and that the association between self-control and a wide range of adult developmental outcomes is already evident in early childhood (Moffitt et al., 2011).","Some polarization is likely inevitable, as human beings show a preference for interacting with similar others and as homophily powerfully structures our social relationships (McPherson et al., 2001).","Perhaps because of all these powerful societal implications of homophily based on race, its negative association with social cohesion has a dominating role and undermines the possibility of a positive direct effect of homophily on SWB.","By contrast, benevolent sexism simultaneously entices women with offers of safety while disempowering them with restrictive expectations.","Its protective appeal goes hand in hand with the disempowerment of women within relationships.","Thus, prior research typically focused on indirect forms of disempowerment (e.g., benevolent sexism undermining women's career aspirations; Kuchynka et al., 2017).","These features made it a particularly convenient place to find relevant content to analyze and an important context to study: Its discourse can powerfully shape decisions of voters as well as lawmakers (Brady et al., 2021;Frimer et al., 2022).","Regarding the first explanation, we offer a psychological profile of people who frequently react to politicians' tweets, thereby powerfully shaping perceived norms and real-world outcomes.","Statistical learning is a powerful mechanism that enables the rapid extraction of regularities from sensory inputs.","In numerous studies, statistical learning was suggested as a powerful mechanism for determining what information is prioritized in perception (e.g., the effect of statistical learning on visual attention; Chun &amp; Jiang, 1998;Wang &amp; Theeuwes, 2018).","This is staggering, given that a large body of work exists showing powerful attentional-enhancement effects in both adults (Bashinski &amp; Bacharach, 1980;Eriksen &amp; Hoffman, 1974;Jonides, 1980) and children (Lane &amp; Pearson, 1983;Pozuelos et al., 2014;Wainwright &amp; Bryson, 2002) that are observed even when no filtering is required during attentional selection."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>id<\/th>\n      <th>text<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":5,"dom":"tip","columnDefs":[{"name":"id","targets":0},{"name":"text","targets":1}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[5,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

definition, have no false negatives, but further refining of your module
will start to produce both false positives and negatives.</p>
<p>You have to set up two files to match the module output. First, the
sample of files to check.</p>

Verrochi, 2009), by simultaneously assessing affect at both Internet-aggregate and laboratory-sample levels of analysis, our studies provide consistent evidence that photograph-elicited positive arousal most powerfully promoted lending rates and outcomes (Tables 1 and2, Fig. 2a, and Fig.","This approach integrates insights from ultimate (evolutionary) and proximate (decision-making) levels of analysis and, in doing so, provides evidence for a powerful process underlying diverse forms of decision making.","Because many respondents reported that they based their sample sizes on rules of thumb or common practice in the field, we recommend that researchers conduct and report formal power analyses for their studies.","It has long been argued that researchers should conduct formal power analyses before starting data collection (Cohen, 1965(Cohen,, 1990), yet it continues to be the case that many studies in the psychological literature are statistically underpowered (Bakker et al., 2012;Cohen, 1990;Maxwell, 2004).","Despite the centrality of power in NHST ( Gigerenzer, 2004), formal power analyses are rarely reported in the literature.","A power analysis was mentioned by 93 (47%) of the respondents (although 20 of these respondents, or 22%, also mentioned practical constraints, such as available time and money).","Considering that 53% of the respondents in the researcher condition indicated that they did not generally conduct power analyses and 23% reported using some rule of thumb, we wondered whether respondents' intuitive power analyses were accurate.","We did not conduct a formal power analysis because we considered this sample sufficiently large for the purposes of estimation.","Finally, we asked them to indicate how often they conducted a power analysis (7-point Likert scale), to assess their own statistical knowledge (10-point scale), and to indicate their main subfield of psychological research.","First, we found that respondents who reported doing power analyses to determine their sample sizes did not estimate power better than those who did not report conducting power analyses.","Almost half of the respondents in the researcher condition in Study 1 indicated that they generally used a power analysis to determine their sample size (although they might not conduct a power analysis for every single study).","Furthermore, the amount of bias did not differ significantly between respondents who mentioned typically doing power analyses (M t = -.31, 95% CI = [-.40, -.22]) and those who did not (M t = -.30, 95% CI = [-.39, -.22]).","Next, for Study 2, we used a principal components analysis to summarize respondents' answers to the questions regarding their understanding of what power means (question correctly answered by 168 respondents, or 78.5%), how often they conducted power analyses, and how good their statistical knowledge was.","The first component explained 50% of the variance, and we used hierarchical regression analyses to investigate whether scores on this component predicted estimates of power and required sample sizes.","In addition, robust regression analyses revealed that number of publications did not significantly predict either calculated power or bias.","With a robust 3 (condition) × 9 (research field) two-way analysis of variance using the trimmed means, we tested for differences between research fields in power and sample-size estimates.","When asked about how they normally determined sample sizes in their own studies, more than half of our respondents indicated that they did not use a power analysis, which may explain why such analyses are presented in fewer than 3% of psychological articles (Bakker &amp; Wicherts, 2011).","Much research in psychology appears to be planned without formal power analysis, and many researchers appear to use rather intuitive approaches in determining their sample sizes.","Even researchers who stated that they typically used formal power analyses had poor power intuitions.","First, researchers should always conduct a formal power analysis when planning a study (preferably, such an analysis would be part of an institutional review board's approval or part of preregistration of the study), and they should report this power analysis in their manuscript, together with a description of their sample.","Second, considering that often no appropriate ES estimation is available and that our results indicate that intuitions for exponential power functions are often suboptimal and potentially linear, we recommend that power analyses be accompanied by inspection of the implications of a range of ES estimates, especially at the lower end of this range.","Third, reviewers should check whether indeed a formal power analysis has been conducted (Asendorpf et al., 2013) and whether it is sound.","Finally, in addition to conducting DNA analyses, we used twin data to obtain the first well-powered estimate of the degree to which intergenerational educational attainment is heritable.","Power analysis for RSA is not straightforward.","We based our power analysis on previous research on the optimistic learning bias (Garrett &amp; Sharot, 2014;Garrett et al., 2014;Korn et al., 2014;Kuzmanovic et al., 2015;Moutsiana et al., 2013;Sharot, Guitart-Masip, et al., 2012;Sharot, Kanai, et al., 2012;Sharot et al., 2011) Time Fig.","Power analyses, measures, conditions, and exclusions are reported in the Supplemental Material available online.","For example, we did not have enough statistical power to examine interactions between the polygenic score and SES, and we restricted our analyses to two broad indicators of antisocial behavior-criminal offending and life-course-persistent antisocial behavior-rather than zooming in on finer distinctions.","There, the relationship-context effect was not significant, probably because these analyses were less powerful than our other analyses.","Using the same data set as Hartgerink (2016), we also extracted information on the degrees of freedom across disciplines for a supplementary analysis of statistical power in psychology articles.","We did not conduct formal power analyses prior to collecting data.","Such analyses are complex with multiple random effects because power varies with the number of stimuli, the number of participants, and the variance associated with each random effect (Westfall, Kenny, &amp; Judd, 2014).","This effect was replicated in Experiments 2 and 3, following a power analysis based on the data of Experiment 1.","For Experiment 2, the sample size was determined through a power analysis based on the data of Experiment 1.","The main analysis focused on the difference in SSVEP power for a 1-s time window after the onset of the outcome stimulus (3-4 s), in contrast to the 1-s presentation of the second picture of the sequence (1.5-2.5 s), subtracted as a baseline.","Notably, this polygenic-score analysis is better powered than the SNP heritability analysis, because it capitalizes on the power of the large discovery sample (N = 643,003).","However, highpowered preregistered studies (Garrison, Finley, &amp; Schmeichel, 2019;Hagger et al., 2016), meta-analyses (Carter, Kofler, Forster, &amp; McCullough, 2015), and theoretical reviews (Friese, Loschelder, Gieseler, Frankenbach, &amp; Inzlicht, 2019;Inzlicht &amp; Friese, 2019) suggest that laboratory depletion effects are small or potentially nonexistent and that previous work suffers from limitations such as ineffective experimental manipulations and low statistical power.","This differs from the power-analysis calculation in our preregistration, in which we incorrectly stated that the power analysis suggested a total sample size of 280.","Although specification-curve analyses demonstrate the robustness of our findings, we call for well-powered replications.","However, no power analyses were conducted in this previous research.","In addition to inconsistent results, there are few standardized procedures, and sample sizes have been small (a mean of 23 per group in one meta-analysis; Brookwell et al., 2013), limiting power and potentially overestimating effect sizes (Button et al., 2013).","EEG spectral analysis provided partial support for a similar sensitivity of infant and adult brain rhythms to unexpected outcomes: Köster et al. reported a 4-Hz (infant theta) power increase in response to unexpected outcomes.","Simulation is a powerful tool; it allows full control over the input to the spectral analysis, so we can test our intuitions about what groundtruth mechanism could have generated a given pattern of results.","Köster et al. report a theta-power increase during 4-Hz stimulation (infant theta range), whereas a similar effect on theta power was absent during 6-Hz stimulation (alpha range) in a control analysis.","In contrast to the two main analyses-theta power during theta-range stimulation and alpha power during alpha-range stimulationthe control analysis looks into one frequency range (theta) whereas the 6-Hz stimulation drives an SSVEP in the other (alpha).","Fifteen of the 16 studies were preregistered; all preregistrations describe power analyses guiding our sample sizes, detailed methods, and analysis plans.","We aimed to achieve power of .95 (rather than the field standard of .8) to allow for potential increases in residual errors arising from online data collection and to increase our power to detect other potential effects (e.g., moderation) in the analyses.","This test was chosen for the power analysis because it directly assessed the central hypothesis, namely, that beliefs about oneself (in this case, beliefs about one's personality traits) would be related to corresponding visual features of the self-portrait.","This test was chosen for the power analysis because it directly assessed the central hypothesis, namely, that attitudes toward oneself (body self-esteem, in this case) would be related to visual features of the body self-portrait.","Importantly, across all of our well-powered longitudinal analyses, we found no evidence that socially oriented positive emotions interfered with people's motivation to engage in CDC-recommended health behaviors.","The full preregistered power analysis for this replication can be found on OSF at [https://osf.io/rkfq5/](https://osf.io/rkfq5/).","Our final sample size (N = 88), after we excluded data from participants as described above, exceeded the sample size required as indicated by the a priori power analysis.","This sample size was selected on the basis of an a priori power analysis that tested the difference between confidence resolution in Session 1 and Session 2 of Experiment 1 (using a two-tailed paired-samples t test with an α of .01).","Analyses with epistemic authority were our secondary preregistered analyses (our study design and power calculations were tailored to the primary analyses: Feedback × Self-View × Condition interaction).","Also, restricting the number of respondents reduces the number of counties included in analyses and may thereby reduce test power.","Sample-size estimation for all experiments was based on a priori power analyses using G*Power (Version 3.1.9.4;Faul et al., 2007).","Thus, our results highlight the myriad effects of emotion on memory. conducted a power analysis based on Madan et al.'s (2017) second experiment.","Prior to the experiment, we conducted a power analysis based on the null hypothesis for the mean ordinal number in the revealed block (for more details regarding the analysis, see below).","We conducted separate power analyses for Experiments 1 and 2 because their effect sizes were different, predicating power in each case on number of observations rather than sample size (because each participant provided a variable number of observations).","It should be noted, however, that this subgroup analysis was likely underpowered because of the low number of preregistered works and the high heterogeneity in the case of effects on perceived scientific consensus.","Thus, although we encourage caution in interpreting the results of potentially underpowered meta-regression analyses (see limitations, described below), we found no evidence suggesting that scientificconsensus messaging could be ineffective or backfire among specific populations.","Because no prior research has directly addressed the question at hand, we did not have an a priori estimate of the effect size of the crucial time-bycomplexity interaction for a formal power analysis.","Because our original power analysis suggested that even with 45 participants we were well powered to detect our effect of interest (namely, the Real-Time Entropy × Trial interaction), we chose to analyze the data at that point rather than collect the last three participants' data.","Note that although we aimed to introduce variability and greater ambiguity in the target stimulus set by selecting three different steps for each object pair, we planned to collapse data across these different morph levels for our main analysis to obtain adequate power.","We set our sample sizes by rounding up to a larger number of participants than suggested by power analyses with power of .8 and a significance level (p) of .05.","When we had no basis for estimating an effect size for the power analysis (Experiments 1a, 5, and 6) or when a pilot study indicated a small effect size (Experiment 3 and 7), we assumed a small effect (ϕ) of .10 (Cohen, 1988).","Power analysis","A power analysis (calculated using the pwr package in the R programming environment; Version 3.6.1.","We note that this analysis has greater power than our analysis of efficiency in training because there were more dyslexia participants using the optimal strategy in the information-integration task during the test (information integration-dyslexia: N = 9, control: N = 17; rule based-dyslexia: N = 16, control: N = 16).","The consequent lack of statistical power may thus be one of the sources of the nonrandom variance observed in Seblova et al.'s (2020) meta-analysis.","The semPower R package (Moshagen &amp; Erdfelder, 2016) was employed for power analysis.","Power analysis.","We note that for four of the topics (climate change, Hitler's suicide, the killing of bin Laden, and the death of Elvis Presley), the number of participants who disbelieved the official story was below the required number according to our power analysis (n = 133); we will revisit this issue in the General Discussion.","For two of the topics (climate change and the killing of bin Laden), the number of participants who disbelieved the official story was below the required number according to our power analysis.","The advantage of polygenic scores is that they can be used to index relevant genetic factors in samples of unrelated individuals by leveraging the statistical power of meta-analysis results from large genome-wide association studies (GWASs).","We used the same power analysis as in Study 5a.","The power analyses used to determine the necessary sample sizes are described in the Supplemental Material available online.","We decided to use the same sample size as in Experiment 1 (for the related power analysis, see the Supplemental Material).","We decided to use the same sample size as in Experiment 1 (for the related power analysis, see the Supplemental Material).","Note that the powersim function in simR allows only two-tailed tests, whereas our preregistered analysis for this effect specified a one-tailed test.","The power analysis revealed a large sample-size requirement because of the small effect sizes detected in previous studies and the type of analyses that we conducted.","Details of the power analysis, including calculations of effect sizes in past studies, appear in our online supplement.","To derive an initial estimate of this relationship, we conducted an initial study using a convenience sample of 33 German-speaking participants (29 female, four male; 30 right handed, three left handed) between the ages of 18 and 55 years (age: M = 28.9 years, SD = 7.3) who were recruited through a research participant database maintained by the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics and by advertisements on the institute website (see the Data Analysis section for post hoc power analysis).","First, analyses in this study were from a substudy trial and were underpowered, precluding a primary focus on the role of intervention in driving the parenting and cumulative risk interaction.","The study was conducted at a time when detailed power analyses were uncommon (2014), so sample size was only determined to clearly exceed the size of standard selective-exposure experiments reported in the literature.","Because the study was conducted at a time when power analyses were quite uncommon (2015), sample sizes were determined by budgetary considerations only.","Basis for the power analysis of the predicted interaction of conditions (control, friendly climate, oppositional climate) and conflict in Study 3 was a mixed-model simulation with data from Study 2.","Poweranalysis simulations are available at [https://osf.io/rx3e6/](https://osf.io/rx3e6/).","As the preregistered analyses had power issues (relatively large dropout due to imprecise exclusion criteria; see the Participants and Design section), we repeated all analyses by applying only two out of three exclusion criteria as a robustness check.","To estimate the required sample size, we ran a power analysis using the simr package in R (Green &amp; MacLeod, 2016).","Therefore, we ran the power analysis using 10 time points per participant.","We report all measures and exclusions (see Supplemental File S2), along with power analyses justifying our sample sizes (see Supplemental File S3).","Power analyses","G*Power was used for the a priori power analysis (Faul et al., 2007).","We used the same stopping rule as in Experiment 1a; we did not carry out a separate G*Power analysis for this experiment but rather used the same power calculation as in Experiment 1a to determine our sample size.","Also, with such statistical power, it can be assumed that the additional analyses that were undertaken would have provided evidence for the alternative hypothesis, if it had been well founded.","We did not base our target sample size on formal power analyses, partly because we had very different predictions for the effects of ValenceDiff and Frame.","Obviously, power estimates for tests involving such small subsets of the data are less important than those for the primary analysis.","We did not conduct an a priori power analysis.","Our team of coders was not large enough to code, by hand, a quarter million tweets, so we took steps to identify a subset that was more feasible for our coders, with the additional goal of maximizing their hit rates for engaging and dismissing tweets, which in turn would maximize the power of our analyses."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>id<\/th>\n      <th>text<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":5,"dom":"tip","columnDefs":[{"name":"id","targets":0},{"name":"text","targets":1}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[5,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script><div class="sourceCode" id="cb30"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

N = 107 groups).","Our estimated participant numbers were based on effect sizes obtained in comparable studies (summarized by de Groot &amp; Smeets, 2017), in which 25 to 30 participants typically provided sufficient statistical power (80%) to detect a small-to-medium-sized effect (Hedges's g = .36, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [.31, .41]) on comparable indirect measures of emotion, such as facial electromyography, face ratings, startle reflexes, and neural responses (α = .05; correlation among repeated measures: r = .8).","This sample size was chosen to give 80% power to detect a small effect size (r) of .15.","This sample size was chosen to improve statistical power relative to Study 1 and would give 85% power to detect an effect (r) of .15.","The sample size was based on a previous study in younger adults (Lockwood, Hamonet, et al., 2017) and a power calculation that showed that we had 91% power to detect a medium effect size (d = 0.5) with at least 92 participants in each group.","Because we were interested in determining how manipulated scenes would affect interpretation, we used a conservative effect size (d) of 0.5, an alpha of .05, and power of .8 for our sample-size computation (G*Power Version 3.1.9.2; Faul et al., 2007).","The estimated sample size was 34 participants, but we used 36 to fit the counterbalancing (six conditions), which yielded a power estimate of .83.","Because we were interested in determining the effects of fixation position on interpretation, we used a medium effect size (d) of 0.6, an alpha of .004 ( Bonferroni corrected for the current study), and power of .8 for our sample-size computation (G*Power Version 3.1.9.2; Faul et al., 2007).","The estimated sample size was 33 participants, but to fit the counterbalancing, we recruited 48, which yielded a power estimate of .86.","Given only our anticipated lab-based sample, 420 participants would allow a power of .80 to detect a small effect size (r) of .12-although our aim was to collect substantially more than this number.","On the basis of the estimated standard errors in the main specification, I had 80% power to detect an effect of around 0.2 in IHS units for successful replications and around 0.18 IHS units for failed replications at an α of .05, corresponding to 0.19 and 0.17 standard deviations, respectively.","With that sample size, the minimum detectable effect size with statistical power at the recommended .80 level was a Cohen's d of 0.32 for mean comparisons between participants who received a good signal and participants who received a bad signal and a Cohen's d of 0.46 for mean comparisons between the four possible combinations of signals (Cohen, 1988).","This smaller sample was enough to detect a medium effect size (η p 2 = .066) with .90 power and an α of .05 for Hypothesis 2 (Faul et al., 2009).","Even if a true effect existed in our sample of climate-change deniers similar in size to the one we found in Experiment 3 about genetically engineered food, then the experiment about climate change was underpowered (achieved power ~55%).","Assuming the smallest effect size of interest (r = .3) between each of the pathways (a, b, and c′), we estimated that a total sample size of 240 participants would provide power of .95 to detect a significant mediation effect with an α of .05.","Given our sample size of 50 per group, with 18 repetitions per observation in our primary task, we had approximately 90% power to detect three-way interactions with a small effect size (Cohen's d = 0.2).","This sample size, reflecting the number of participants we successfully managed to recruit across a fixed-duration recruitment period of 2 months, provided high power (&gt; 99.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [99.6, 100.0]) to detect an estimated medium-size effect for the fixed effect of self-reported personality traits in the linear mixed-effects model.","Power calculations were based on Monte Carlo simulations using the simr package (Version 1.0.5; Green &amp; MacLeod, 2016) in the R programming environment.","This sample size provided adequate power (81.4%, 95% CI = [78.9, 83.8]) to detect an estimated medium-size effect (slope: β = 0.35; Acock, 2014) for the fixed main effect of body self-esteem in the linear mixed-effects model.","Power calculations were done in accordance with the guidelines of the Social Sciences Replication Project (SSRP), which states that the first round of data collection must achieve 90% power to detect 75% of the original effect size.","The pooled sample (both the first and second stage) must achieve 90% power to detect 50% of the original effect size; in our case, this meant that an additional 882 participants (or 26,443 ratings) would be recruited if the replication failed in the first round, for a total of 1,583 participants in the pooled sample.","To obtain 80% statistical power to detect an estimated 20% increase in mean loginsconsistent with effects found in prior research in onlinelearning environments (e.g., Davis et al., 2017)-would require 458 participants.","The sample of 97 participants yielded a power of 99.8% for a paired contrast (two tailed) in the case of a medium effect size (d = 0.5) or 49.6% power in the case of a weak effect size (d = 0.2), based on an a priori Type I error rate (α) of .05.","This sample size was chosen to ensure at least 80% power (two tailed) to detect an effect of medium size (d ≥ 0.5) within each level given 34 participants per level, plus margin for potential rejection of unreliable data.","The resulting sample of 194 participants yielded a power of 87.8% (one tailed) to detect a weak correlation (r = .2).","For Study 3, we calculated that a minimum sample size of 950 would be required to achieve a standardized effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.20 with an α of .05 and 80% power.","This sample size is greater than is common in other demonstrations of the LPE (e.g., Fleck &amp; Mitroff, 2007;Wolfe et al., 2005Wolfe et al.,, 2007) ) and is sufficient to detect an effect when a target is present on only 20% of trials, given .95 power and a .05 tolerance for Type I errors using a paired-samples t test.","It turned out that a sample of at least 164 participants would be necessary to obtain the assumed power.","Given an α of .05 and N predictor of 8, a minimum of 77 participants would give us a power of .8 to detect an effect using F tests for multiple linear regression.","Consistent with these observations, a repeated measures ANOVA with location (0°, 45°, and 90°) as a repeated variable showed a significant effect of location on thresholds, F GG (2, 8.36) = 10.73, p = .010, η p 2 = .573, power = .831.","Consistent with these observations, a repeated measures ANOVA with location as a repeated variable showed no effect of location on bias, F(2, 16) = 1.142, p = .344, η p 2 = .125, power = .216, and one-sample t tests comparing bias with zero were not significant for any reference position-0°: t(8) = 0.43, p = .677; 45°: t(8) = 0.055, p = .958; 90°: t(8) = 1.25, p = .247.","Consistent with these observations, a repeated measures ANOVA with location as a repeated variable showed a significant effect of location on click intensity (in decibels of sound-pressure level [db SPL]), F(2, 16) = 8.73, p = .003, η p 2 = .522, power = .934.","A sample size of 50 provides 80% power to detect within-subjects effects (i.e., among four familiarity conditions) of f ≥ .17, between-subjects effects (i.e., between two training groups) of f ≥ .32, and withinbetween-subjects interactions of f ≥ .17 (Faul et al., 2007).","At the survey level, we had 80% power to detect between-and within-subjects effects of 0.18 and 0.08, respectively.","Calculations using G*Power (Version 3.1.7;Faul et al., 2009) showed that this sample size would yield a power of greater than 90% to detect medium-sized effects of evaluative information and interactions of evaluative information and attention tasks (η p 2 = .06).","We decided to obtain a sample size that would allow us to detect a within-subjects difference of at least a medium effect size (Cohen's d &gt; 0.5) with 80% power, using a twotailed t test.","The procedure demonstrates sufficient power to detect medium-to-large effects in adequately large samples ( Jones et al., 2020).","Still, we decided on a sample size of 75 prior to data collection, as this is enough to detect moderate effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.4 or more in 80% power; Batterink et al., 2015;Forest et al., 2021), which is conservative and smaller than the typical effects observed in various statistical-learning paradigms.","This provided us with an expected power value at each sample size (i.e., from 10-75), which allowed us to determine that after ~35 participants, we continuously achieved 90% power to detect the estimated interaction (Real-Time Entropy × Trial) from Experiment 1.","Given that our median sample size (N = 2,270) already yielded very high statistical power (&gt; .95) for even a miniscule and negligible effect (ΔR² = .005; Jobst et al., in press), we did not consider statistical significance.","Calculations in G*Power (Version 3.1;Faul et al., 2007), based on a previous study of cardiac gating on emotional valence (Garfinkel et al., 2014), indicated that a sample size of 35 would be needed to obtain an effect size (f 2 ) of .40 at a power of 85% with an α of .05, which is consistent with other studies in the field (Azevedo et al., 2018;Li et al., 2020).","With a power of 80%, one would be able to detect a significant effect size r of .23.","Yet, given our sample size of 309 dyads and thus 618 behavioral and liking assessments, it would be possible to detect a significant effect size r of .11 with a power of 80%.","; R Core Team, 2019; see Champely, 2020) indicated that a sample of 21 participants per group would be needed to obtain statistical power at a 0.80 level (α = .05) to detect a small-to-medium difference among conditions (d = 0.37 or f = 0.185).","An optimal sample size of 28 participants was determined a priori using G*Power software (Faul et al., 2007) with 80% power to detect small to medium effects (Cohen's f = 0.14) of food deprivation on self-reported measures of stress and mood (MacCormack &amp; Lindquist, 2019) with .05 α error probability and correlation among repeated measures of .5.","A sample size of 1,892 was associated with nearly 100% power to reject an incorrect model (amount of misspecification set at root-mean-square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.050, α = .005).","Using G*Power (Faul et al., 2007), we predetermined that a sample size of 150 would be necessary to detect a medium-size between-subjects effect with an α of .05 and a statistical power of .80 in a mixed ANOVA for Studies 1 and 2.","We predetermined that a sample size of 60 would be needed to detect a medium-size effect with an α of .05 and a statistical power of .80 in a logistic regression.","Detecting a correlation of .24 with 80% power would require at least 133 participants who do not believe the official version of events.","This sample size also provided 80% power for the Fisher's r-to-z tests (Hypothesis 2) to detect an effect size below medium (q = .269) in the case of highly skewed distributions (e.g., at least 133 participants disbelieve and 667 believe the official version); for more even distributions (e.g., 400 believers and 400 disbelievers), this sample size provided 80% power to detect even smaller effect sizes (q = .199).","A total of 5,261 participants responded to the questionnaire containing the measures for the present project (2,942 men, 2,319 women; age: M = 51.37 years, SD = 18.28), yielding high statistical power to investigate the current hypotheses.","At this level of simulated noise, we estimated 100% power (α = .05) to detect a stronger IPS association with crystallized performance than with fluid performance.","Participants contributed on average 2.33 observations for subjective age (range 1-7), resulting in an overall number of observations amounting to 34,792, which should correspond to sufficient statistical power to detect small to medium effect sizes.","This sample size provided approximately 80% power to detect a moderate to large effect size (ds = 0.5-0.7) and is consistent with or larger than sample sizes used in previous experiments on children's metaphor comprehension (e.g., Zhu et al., 2020, in press).","The sample size was determined by an a priori power calculation for a dependent-samples t test (based on the difference in mean avoidance behavior between conditions during the test of generalization; G*Power, Faul et al., 2009; α = .05, power = .80, d = 0.50), which yielded a minimum sample size of 34.","We posted recruitment flyers in each university with a goal of attaining 90% statistical power to detect the average effect size (d = 0.43) in social psychology (Richard et al., 2003).","The final sample had 97% statistical power for this effect size.","We targeted a sample size of 117 applicants, based on a medium effect size (φ = 0.3) and 90% power.","To estimate the sample size, we ran a small pretest on Prolific and used the smallest effect size (d = 0.56) to estimate the sample size needed for 90% statistical power (N = 204).","We treated this as a minimum and recruited 500 participants to ensure that our study was appropriately powered and to account for potential exclusions.","As discussed in Study 3, our power calculation suggested that detecting a small to medium effect required approximately 200 participants.","The results showed that 180 participants are sufficient to achieve a power of 92.25%.","To detect an effect of the size of the lower bound of the smaller (and more relevant) effect on recognition accuracy, we needed a d z of 0.34, with 95% power required for a total sample size of 115 (two-tailed test).","This resulted in a total sample size of 230 for the replication study, equipping each of the direct replication conditions (no announcement for the Ackerman stimuli) with 95% power to detect an effect at the lower bound of the 95% CI of the original Ackerman findings.","For the central effect size, the double difference score of (White neutral -Black neutral) versus (White angry -Black angry), a sample size of 400 participants equipped us with 90% power to find evidence for equivalence in the critical smallest effect size of interest window from d z = -0.165 to d z = 0.165.","We estimated the sample size required for a between-subjects design with three conditions (mindful-gratitude practice, mindful-attention practice, and control) and a continuous moderator (collective narcissism) for an alpha level of .05 and power of .80.","Our estimation produced a sample size of 432 (G*Power 3.1; Faul et al., 2009).","We assumed an alpha level of .05 with power of .80, and we carried out the calculations via G*Power 3.1 (Faul et al., 2009).","For a paired-samples t test (e.g., estimate differences between high-and low-friction conditions) and a minimally interesting effect size of .80 from piloting, a desired power of .80, and a Type I error rate of 5%, we obtained a group size of n = 15.","On the basis of pilot data, we determined that a minimum of 30 participants was sufficient to achieve power = 0.95 and α = 0.05.","A G*Power (Version 3.1; Faul et al., 2009) analy sis using pilot data from 20 participants for a Bonferroni-corrected (for two comparisons) one-sample t test (d = 0.45, α = .05, p = .95) determined that we should recruit 67 participants.","All sample sizes were set a priori and were sufficient to detect a small interaction ( f 2 = 0.06) with 80% power.","For Experiment 1, we aimed for a convenience sample of 600 participants to ensure sufficient statistical power (α &gt; .90) to detect small-to-medium-sized interaction effects in the present design (Cohen, 1992; see Text S5 in the Supplemental Material).","To provide sufficient statistical power (α &gt; .90) to detect small-to-medium-sized interaction effects in the present design (Cohen, 1992), we aimed for a convenience sample of 300 participants (see Text S5 in the Supplemental Material).","To provide sufficient statistical power (α &gt; .90) to detect small-to-medium-sized effects in the present design (Cohen, 1992), we aimed for a convenience sample of 500 participants.","For Experiments 4a and 4b, we each aimed for a convenience sample of 600 participants to ensure sufficient statistical power (α &gt; .90) to detect small-to-mediumsized effects in the respective experiment designs (Cohen, 1992).","With 900 participants (our target), power was .999 for a very small effect of ValenceDiff and .96 for a small residual effect of Frame.","With 500 participants (slightly fewer than in our student sample), power was .97 for a very small effect of ValenceDiff and .81 for a small effect of Frame.","This provided 80% power to detect differences between engaging and dismissing-d = 0.38 (Study 1a) and d = 0.47 (Study 1b).","After reviewing the effect size (Cohen's d = 0.34) of a previous study that used the bias-free b-CFS paradigm to measure conscious access (Litwin et al., 2023), we concluded that a sample of 55 participants was needed for an experimental power of 80% with an alpha level of 0.05 for a planned one-tailed paired-samples t test (power calculation performed in G*Power).","With a sample size of 20, the power was 100%."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>id<\/th>\n      <th>text<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":5,"dom":"tip","columnDefs":[{"name":"id","targets":0},{"name":"text","targets":1}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[5,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

Fanelli, 2010;Sterling, Rosenbaum, &amp; Weinkam, 1995).","In a more recent and fairly representative sample of 271 psychological articles that involved the use of NHST (Bakker &amp; Wicherts, 2011), only 3% of the authors explicitly discussed power as a consideration in designing their studies.","In addition, when Greenwald (1975) asked social psychologists what the acceptable Type II error rate was, the average response was around .27, which means that an acceptable level of power would be .73, which again is markedly higher than the overall power estimates for published studies, as reported by Cohen (1990) and Bakker et al.","In our second study, respondents estimated the actual power of several research designs and the sample size that would be required to achieve a power of .80 in various research designs.","A power analysis was mentioned by 93 (47%) of the respondents (although 20 of these respondents, or 22%, also mentioned practical constraints, such as available time and money).","Furthermore, 45 respondents (23%) mentioned some rule of thumb (e.g., 20 subjects per condition), 41 respondents (21%) based sample sizes on the common practice in their field of research, and 18 respondents (9%) wanted as many subjects as possible, to have the highest possible power to detect an effect.","As the distributions were not normal and included outliers (histograms and medians are presented in the Supplemental Material), we report the trimmed means (M t s; 20% trimming) and used robust statistics to increase power and to protect against an incorrect estimation of the Type I error rate (Bakker &amp; Wicherts, 2014;Welch, 1938;Wilcox, 2012;Yuen, 1974).","The average reported acceptable levels for α and power were .05 and .80, respectively.","Responses to these questions, in particular, seemed to reflect a common standard, as 83% of our respondents reported that the acceptable α level is .05, and 69% reported that power of .80 is sufficient.","However, for an independent-samples t test with 20 to 25 subjects in each condition and d of 0.5 (medium ES), the actual power lies between .34 and .41, which is approximately half the power that the respondent mentioned.","Considering that 53% of the respondents in the researcher condition indicated that they did not generally conduct power analyses and 23% reported using some rule of thumb, we wondered whether respondents' intuitive power analyses were accurate.","Such a study would have power of .35.","(When we calculated power separately for each respondent's reported values of α, ES, and n, we found that the trimmed mean power across respondents was .40.)","A robust within-subjects Yuen t test (Wilcox, 2012;Yuen, 1974) indicated that respondents' reported acceptable power levels differed significantly from the calculated power based on their responses to the other questions, t(171) = 19.38, p &lt; .001, ξ = .82, 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference = [.36, .44].","The trimmed mean bias was -.34; 80% of the respondents showed a negative bias (calculated power lower than desired power), and 33% showed a negative bias with an absolute value larger than .5.","A majority of the respondents in Study 1 reported that power of .80 is satisfactory, and this is the common standard advised by Cohen (1965) and other researchers.","Additionally, we presented examples of research designs with α and ES specified, and asked respondents to estimate the number of subjects needed to reach a power of .80.","The first 3 asked the respondents to estimate the power of independent-samples (two-tailed) t tests in three research situations, which differed in the ES (Cohen's d = 0.20, 0.50, or 0.80); α was set at .05 throughout.","In the next 3 questions, we asked the respondents to estimate the sample sizes required for an independent-samples t test to have a power of .80 given expected ESs (Cohen's d ) of 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80; each ES was accompanied by the corresponding correlation (.10, .24, or .37, respectively), and α was again set at .05.","We calculated the true power of the research designs presented to the respondents using the pwr package in R (Champely, 2009); these values are presented in Table 1 and Figure 1, along with the 20% trimmed means and 95% CIs for the respondents' estimates.","The true power lay within the 95% CI for only one scenario in the medium-N condition (when d = 0.50) and one scenario in the small-N condition (when d = 0.80).","The vast majority of respondents (89%) overestimated power for the small-ES scenario.","A comparable pattern was found when respondents estimated the sample sizes required to obtain a power of .80 in an independent-samples t test, given a specific expected ES.","The average calculated power for this group of respondents (M t = .46, 95% CI = [.37, .55]) was not significantly higher than that for the remaining respondents in the researcher condition (M t = .42, 95% CI = [.34, .51]).","Furthermore, the amount of bias did not differ significantly between respondents who mentioned typically doing power analyses (M t = -.31, 95% CI = [-.40, -.22]) and those who did not (M t = -.30, 95% CI = [-.39, -.22]).","Next, for Study 2, we used a principal components analysis to summarize respondents' answers to the questions regarding their understanding of what power means (question correctly answered by 168 respondents, or 78.5%), how often they conducted power analyses, and how good their statistical knowledge was.","The first component explained 50% of the variance, and we used hierarchical regression analyses to investigate whether scores on this component predicted estimates of power and required sample sizes.","We did not find a significant effect of component score on power estimates for the small-ES scenario (b = -0.01, t = -0.98, p = .329).","However, when the ES was medium or large, respondents with higher component scores had higher (and hence more accurate) power estimates (b = 0.02, t = 2.26, p = .025, and b = 0.04, t = 3.94, p &lt; .001, respectively).","Furthermore, when the specified ES was large, respondents with higher component scores gave smaller estimates of the sample size required to achieve a power of .80 (b = -12.89, t = -2.56, p = .011), which again resulted in estimates closer to the true value.","When asked about how they normally determined sample sizes in their own studies, more than half of our respondents indicated that they did not use a power analysis, which may explain why such analyses are presented in fewer than 3% of psychological articles (Bakker &amp; Wicherts, 2011).","The power intuitions of more than 75% of respondents resulted in calculated power that was lower than desired.","In our second study, 89% of respondents overestimated the power of studies with small expected ESs, and 95% underestimated the sample size required for sufficient power when the ES was small.","When the expected ES was small, the true sample size needed to reach a power of .80 was more than 3 times the respondents' mean estimate of the required sample size.","Furthermore, the response rate in both studies was quite low (26% and 13%, respectively), and researchers who are knowledgeable about power are probably overrepresented in this sample because of their interest in the subject.","More generally, any factor affecting the distribution of p values and their frequency in the interval .05 to .10, such as the statistical power of research, p hacking, or merely the reporting of statistical results, will affect the percentage of articles reporting one or more results as marginally significant.","Note that possible trends in p-value reporting and power do not affect the percentage of p values reported as marginally significant, as that percentage is conditional on the p value being between .05 and .10.","In 999 of 1,000 iterations, the g factor was preferred, suggesting 99.9% power to prefer the g-factor model if it was indeed the data-generating mechanism.","With our current model specification and sample size, we had 73% power to detect a small coupling effect (r = .1, as defined by Gignac &amp; Szodorai, 2016) but effectively 100% power to detect intermediate (r = .2) and large (r = .3) effects.","On the basis of the standard errors of the estimates, we also computed the approximate statistical power (1 -β) of these tests for a significance level (α) of 1% to allow evaluation of the conclusiveness of nonsignificant effects.","As an effect size under the alternative hypothesis, the median OR reported by Lu and colleagues (OR = 1.065) was used for the power calculations.","Moreover, the GAM used splines to model monthly seasonal trends and the geographic locations of districts, whereas the GLM assumed (discrete) fixed effects for months. b = estimate for the effect of the z-standardized pollution variable in a negative binomial regression; OR = odds ratio; 1 -β = approximate statistical power of the Wald test for a significance level (α) equal to 1% based on the median effect size reported by Lu, Lee, Gino, and Galinsky (2018; OR = 1.065); BF 01 = Bayes factor against the incremental effect of air pollution. littering, begging, or fireworks misuse.","Likewise, none of the frequentist Wald tests were significant at the nominal level (α) of 1% despite the high statistical power for all dependent variables (1 -β ≥ 93%).","Specifically, the evoked spectral power was obtained by complex Morlet's wavelets (Morlet parameter m = 7) at a resolution of 0.5 Hz for theta and alpha for each channel individually (Formulas 1 to 4 in Kaspar, Hassler, Martens, Trujillo-Barreto, &amp; Gruber, 2010).","The grand mean SSVEP signal was quantified by subtracting a prestimulus baseline (from -0.5 s to -0.25 s) from the SSVEP power.","The main analysis focused on the difference in SSVEP power for a 1-s time window after the onset of the outcome stimulus (3-4 s), in contrast to the 1-s presentation of the second picture of the sequence (1.5-2.5 s), subtracted as a baseline.","Throughout the stimulus presentation (0-4.5 s), theta and alpha SSVEPs were significantly above the prestimulus baseline level, both ts(37) &gt; 7.46, p &lt; .001, with higher SSVEP power for entrained theta compared with alpha, t(37) = 3.38, p = .002.","Post hoc t tests revealed a sharp increase in SSVEP power for the onset of unexpected compared with expected outcomes for the theta stimulation, t(37) = 2.85, p = .007, but no difference was found for the alpha stimulation, t(37) = 0.41, p = .684 (Fig. 2b).","Nevertheless, the small but meaningful effect size (reduced boundary effect: d = -0.15) suggests that researchers hoping to examine similar effects should use within-subjects designs to ensure sufficient statistical power, especially given that the boundary effect was present even after we accounted for within-subjects learning effects in our studies.","In the case of the Big Two, the power of culture was .11 (when the Big Two scales were constructed with the target-scale method), .11 (when the 1.","Big Two scales were constructed with the ant-colony method), and .13 (when the Big Two scales were constructed with the brute-force method), and the power of personality was .15 (target scale), .22 (ant colony), and .21 (brute force).","In the case of the Big Five, the power of culture was .08, and the power of personality was .38.","For replication studies, Simonsohn (2015) recommends testing an effect size that an original study had 33% power to detect.","Samples 2.5 times larger than the original have roughly 80% power to reject population effect sizes of this magnitude.","But can we reject the null of the effect size (d z ) being as large as ±0.35-what the original study had 33% power to detect?","The cutoff frequencies were decided by visually inspecting the power spectrum averaged across participants, which showed clear drops at 0.1 Hz and 0.18 Hz, suggesting the coexistence of fluctuations of different natures (see Fig.","We then created time-frequency plots (averaged over the expected and unexpected conditions), as well as summary plots showing theta and alpha time courses separately for the expected-and unexpected-outcome conditions (baseline corrected as in the original study by subtracting the average power between 1.5 s and 2.5 s with respect to the onset of the flicker stimulus), as in Köster et al.","The \"small-telescopes\" approach of Simonsohn ( 2015) is based on the idea of detectability in that it tests whether the effect obtained in a replication study is smaller than an effect size that the original study had only 33% power to detect.","In the case of climate change, we found moderate evidence against the effectiveness of an extensive boost (the boost+ condition) to correct a misperception (BF 10 = 0.18; increase in belief in true statement: d = 0.04), whereas a high-powered experiment about genetically engineered food yielded extreme evidence in favor of boosting consensus reasoning to aid participants to come to an accurate belief (BF 10 = 309.98; decrease in belief in false statement: d = -0.35).","This yielded both power and phase values of 18 frequency bins from 0 Hz to 20.6 Hz.","This created a distribution of 10,000 power values for each frequency bin, from which we determined the statistical thresholds (p = .005; i.e., Bonferroni corrected for tests in 10 frequency bins).","Specifically, 6-Hz fluctuations for TMT A trials timelocked to template A were significantly larger than the power observed in our distribution of surrogate data (Fig. 4 we observed a significant peak at 9.7 Hz for TMT B trials if time-locked to template B (p &lt; .001, d = 0.39).","We aimed to achieve power of .95 (rather than the field standard of .8) to allow for potential increases in residual errors arising from online data collection and to increase our power to detect other potential effects (e.g., moderation) in the analyses.","In our independent replication, we found that the first stage of data collection, calculated to achieve 90% power to detect 75% of the target study's effect size, was unsuccessful: We found no significant difference between the treatment and control groups in truth discernment (p = .67).","After a second stage of data collection (the pooled sample size was powered at 90% to detect 50% of the original effect size), we replicated the treatment effect.","All power calculations were performed using G*Power (Version 3.1; Faul et al., 2009).","This sample size was selected on the basis of an a priori power analysis that tested the difference between confidence resolution in Session 1 and Session 2 of Experiment 1 (using a two-tailed paired-samples t test with an α of .01).","Sample-size estimates were made with G*Power (Version 3.1;Faul et al., 2007).","We assumed a medium effect size (f = 0.15) and power at the level of .90.","We used G*Power (Version 3.1; Faul et al., 2009) to determine the sample size to ensure sufficient power.","Sample-size estimation for all experiments was based on a priori power analyses using G*Power (Version 3.1.9.4;Faul et al., 2007).","The familiar-voice benefit to speech intelligibility found in previous studies has a large effect size (f = 0.72 in Johnsrude et al. (2013) and f = 0.88 in Holmes et al. (2018), and familiarity effects of this size should be detectable with power of about 100% in the current design.","After correction, religiosity was not associated with any other daily empathy or trait empathy measures (all ps &gt; .05), although it is possible that the true effects were smaller than our study was powered to detect (d = 0.33, r = .16).","Further, our study was powered to detect effects (ds) only as small as 0.33 (r = .16) at the trait level, so it is possible that there are true effects that were too small for us to detect.","We set our sample sizes by rounding up to a larger number of participants than suggested by power analyses with power of .8 and a significance level (p) of .05.","When we had no basis for estimating an effect size for the power analysis (Experiments 1a, 5, and 6) or when a pilot study indicated a small effect size (Experiment 3 and 7), we assumed a small effect (ϕ) of .10 (Cohen, 1988).","A power analysis (calculated using the pwr package in the R programming environment; Version 3.6.1.","To derive an initial estimate of this relationship, we conducted an initial study using a convenience sample of 33 German-speaking participants (29 female, four male; 30 right handed, three left handed) between the ages of 18 and 55 years (age: M = 28.9 years, SD = 7.3) who were recruited through a research participant database maintained by the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics and by advertisements on the institute website (see the Data Analysis section for post hoc power analysis).",", calculated using a 95% CI) at a power (β) of 0.90 and alpha of .01.","Autoregressive modeling was then performed for each IBI time series using Kubios software (Niskanen et al., 2004) to identify a peak in the power spectrum in the HF-HRV range (0.15-0.4 Hz) for each participant, which was subsequently used to extract sinusoidal variation in heart rate (HF-HRV) at the participant's most prominent frequency.","Obtaining power greater than .80 for a very small effect of Frame would have required more than 2,000 participants.","For the standard framing effect (L6-G4, target n = 90), power was .94 for the Many Labs effect size (d = 0.60; Klein et al., 2014) and .84 for a medium effect (d = 0.50).","Because of the extremely large sample size, we determined that there was adequate power to detect the hypothesized effects, and we selected a more conservative critical alpha of p = .01."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>id<\/th>\n      <th>text<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":5,"dom":"tip","columnDefs":[{"name":"id","targets":0},{"name":"text","targets":1}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[5,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script><div class="sourceCode" id="cb38"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

Alvarez, 2019) on pilot data collected with a smaller sample (N = 40).","The procedure demonstrates sufficient power to detect medium-to-large effects in adequately large samples ( Jones et al., 2020).","Sample size was determined prior to data collection on the basis of the results of a power analysis using the data from Experiment 1, and it was preregistered on OSF ([https://osf.io/anxvd](https://osf.io/anxvd)).","Given that mutual infidelity events were relatively rare (n = 111, resulting in insufficient power; for sensitivity analyses, see the Supplemental Material available online), we decided to focus on unilateral perpetrator and victim infidelity events here and report the analyses of mutual infidelity in the Supplemental Material.","Although this could be partially explained by differences in power (for sensitivity analyses, see the Supplemental Material), the nature of infidelity-disclosed versus secret-could have played a role, too.","The sample size was determined through a power analysis based on the data of a pilot experiment (reported in the Supplemental Material).","We tested 38 participants (25 females, two other; age: M = 28 years, SD = 5) to arrive at the desired sample size of 35 (based on a power analysis; see Method of Experiments 2 and 3).","A post hoc power analysis was run.","The target sample of our power analysis (at least 133 participants who disbelieved the official version of events) was reached for seven out of eight topics.","On the basis of the same power analysis as in Study 1, we solicited 805 U.S. participants through Note: All conspiracy beliefs were measured on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree).","On the basis of the same power analysis as in Studies 1 and 3, we recruited 801 U.S. participants through Prolific.","Our power analysis indicated that we would require 191 participants to detect an effect of small to medium size ( J.","We treated this as a minimum and recruited 500 participants to ensure that our study was appropriately powered and to account for potential exclusions.","As discussed in Study 3, our power calculation suggested that detecting a small to medium effect required approximately 200 participants.","Study 2a participants provided two observations, and 2b participants six; in each case we targeted 1,200 total observations (preregistration links noted in the open practices section provide a priori power analyses justifying this sample size).","We initially targeted 240 participants-160 representing the majority who rarely or never react to politicians' tweets, and 80 of the more unusual participants who frequently do so (for a priori power analyses justifying this sample size, see the preregistration)."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>id<\/th>\n      <th>text<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":5,"dom":"tip","columnDefs":[{"name":"id","targets":0},{"name":"text","targets":1}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[5,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
