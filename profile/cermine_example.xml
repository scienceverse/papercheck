        <p>We examined associations between sexist beliefs and tolerance of violence against women in India using a nationally representative probability sample of adults (n = 133,398). Research consistently indicates that hostile sexism fosters tolerance of violence against women. However, benevolent sexism is sometimes associated with higher tolerance and sometimes with lower tolerance of violence. We proposed that this inconsistency could be resolved by considering the source of violence: Is violence perpetrated by outsiders or intimate partners? Results of a multigroup structural equation model showed that endorsement of hostile sexism was related to greater tolerance of violence regardless of the source. In contrast, endorsement of benevolent sexism was associated with lower tolerance of violence from outsiders but was simultaneously associated with higher tolerance of spousal violence. These opposing processes indicate that although benevolent sexism promises women protection from violence, the very same ideology legitimizes spousal violence, thereby reinforcing men's power within intimate relationships.</p>

        Violence against women in India periodically garners
global attention and sparks local discontent following
major cases of sexual assault
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">(Roychowdhury, 2013)</xref>
        .
But Indian women also routinely face violence that is
much less conspicuous: Nearly one in five report
experiencing sexual harassment in public “often” or “very
often,” and the estimated lifetime rate of domestic
violence for women is 41%
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref24">(Kalokhe et al., 2017; Desai &amp;
Malhotra, 2018)</xref>
        . This public and private violence occurs
in a societal context in which sexist beliefs are relatively
prevalent
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">(Sreemol, 2018)</xref>
        . However, no studies have
examined the link between sexism and tolerance of
violence against women in India. We fill this gap by
testing the relationship between two sexist ideologies
(hostile sexism and benevolent sexism) and tolerance
of violence from two sources (outsiders and intimate
partners). Thus, we leverage a unique sample from an
underrepresented population (n = 133,398) to address
a long-standing question in gender relations: How do
ambivalent attitudes toward women (both protective
and punitive) simultaneously function to maintain
gender inequality?

      <title>Ambivalent Sexism Theory</title>
      <p>
        Ambivalent sexism theory proposes that sexist beliefs
take two distinct forms—hostile sexism and benevolent
sexism
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(Glick &amp; Fiske, 1996)</xref>
        . Hostile sexism comprises
overtly negative beliefs, characterizing women as
manipulative, power-hungry, and oversensitive.
Benevolent sexism presents a highly idealized view of women
as uniquely caring, moral, and deserving of men’s
admiration and protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hostile sexism and benevolent sexism are both
theorized to legitimize gender inequality and harm women
in distinct ways. The aggressive content of hostile sexism
directly enforces norms of men’s power
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Bareket &amp; Fiske,
2023)</xref>
        , fostering discrimination against powerful women
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29 ref43">(Masser &amp; Abrams, 2004)</xref>
        and opposition to
genderbased policies
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">(Hideg &amp; Ferris, 2013)</xref>
        . In contrast, the
patronizing content of benevolent sexism indirectly
enforces men’s power through gender-role norms
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Bareket &amp; Fiske, 2023)</xref>
        , undermining women’s career
aspirations
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">(Kuchynka et  al., 2017)</xref>
        and willingness to
challenge gender inequality

      <title>Sexism and Violence</title>
      <p>
        Of the many gender inequalities, violence against
women is particularly complex because prejudice
toward women combines antipathy and idealization.
One possible consequence of this ambivalence is that
hostile sexism fosters violence whereas benevolent
sexism mitigates violence. However, the evidence does
not bear out this straightforward pattern. In a
metaanalysis of 152 studies, hostile sexism strongly
predicted greater tolerance of violence, whereas benevolent
sexism was a weak predictor of greater tolerance
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Agadullina et al., 2022)</xref>
        . Some findings show negative
associations between benevolent sexism and tolerance
of violence
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">(Saunders et al., 2017)</xref>
        , others show positive
associations
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">(Yamawaki et al., 2009)</xref>
        , and many findings
are null
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Bareket &amp; Fiske, 2023)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        These inconsistent results occur alongside theoretical
complexity. From one perspective, benevolent sexism
should engender lower tolerance of violence because
it prescribes that “women should be cherished and
protected by men”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(Glick &amp; Fiske, 1996, p. 512)</xref>
        . However,
the tenets of ambivalent sexism theory are also
consistent with the possibility that benevolent sexism fosters
greater tolerance of violence. For instance, the
idealization of women sets impossible standards for women’s
behavior, putting them chronically at risk of being
judged as behaving “badly”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Glick &amp; Fiske, 2001)</xref>
        .
Accordingly, people who endorse benevolent sexism
respond punitively to deviations from the “ideal
woman,” such as legitimizing violence against women
who are unfaithful
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref43">(Abrams et  al., 2003; Viki et  al.,
2004)</xref>
        or being more willing to dissolve romantic
relationships when partners fall short of their standards
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Hammond &amp; Overall, 2014)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, an enduring puzzle in sexism research is
whether benevolent sexism is protective or punitive.
Previous null findings have been interpreted as
benevolent sexism promising more than it delivers—it expresses
that women deserve protection but fails to promote
protective behavior
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(Glick et al., 2002)</xref>
        . We argue that
this represents an incomplete picture of benevolent

      <title>Statement of Relevance</title>
      <p>
        Violence against women is a major health and
social-justice issue around the world. But it is an
especially urgent problem in places with higher
gender inequality, such as India, where it remains
understudied. We assessed the sexist beliefs of a
broad cross-section of Indian society to
understand how such violence is tolerated and to
resolve inconsistencies in past research. We found
that the more overtly sexist beliefs people held,
the more they tolerated violence perpetrated by
outsiders and by intimate partners. In contrast,
the more people held patriarchal beliefs that
women should be protected by men, the less
tolerant they were of outsider violence, but the more
tolerant they were of spousal violence. This
suggests that to solve the pervasive problem of
violence against women, it is not just hostile gender
stereotypes that must be challenged but also the
seemingly protective yet patriarchal sexist beliefs
that are prevalent across societies.
sexism arising from research that (a) overlooks its
specific role in maintaining men’s access to relational
intimacy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Hammond &amp; Overall, 2017)</xref>
        and (b) overrelies
on Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and
developed (WEIRD) samples
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(Henrich et al., 2010)</xref>
        . We
propose a new model in which benevolent sexism is both
protective and punitive depending on whether violence
is committed by outsiders or by intimate partners.

      <title>Sexism and Intimacy</title>
      <p>
        Ambivalent sexism theory proposes that gender
relations are different from other intergroup relations
because the high-status group’s advantages exist
alongside intimate interdependence with the low-status
group. This interdependence is theorized to produce
ambivalent, rather than purely hostile, sexist beliefs
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Glick &amp; Fiske, 2001)</xref>
        . Benevolent sexism is theorized
to facilitate intimacy, whereas hostile sexism maintains
men’s power. Accordingly, research shows that hostile
sexism increases men’s societal advantages over time
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(Brandt, 2011)</xref>
        but has relational costs, such as
undermining heterosexual men’s fulfillment of romantic
needs
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Hammond &amp; Overall, 2017)</xref>
        . In contrast,
benevolent sexism has relational benefits, such as increasing
men’s relative appeal to women
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Bohner et al., 2010)</xref>
        and improving relationship satisfaction
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(Hammond
et al., 2020)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the relational nature of benevolent sexism
is central to ambivalent sexism theory, research has
often neglected the domain of relationships. However,
a growing literature now suggests that benevolent
sexism maintains conventional gender roles via
interpersonal processes within romantic relationships
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18 ref3">(Bareket
&amp; Fiske, 2023; Hammond &amp; Overall, 2017)</xref>
        . Extending
this idea, we propose that benevolent sexism should
predict more tolerance of violence in the relationship
domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Benevolent sexism frames relationships with men as
a sanctuary for women
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">(Sarlet et al., 2012)</xref>
        , thus
reinforcing women’s dependence on men
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref39">(Hammond &amp;
Overall, 2015; Shnabel et al., 2016)</xref>
        . It heightens
women’s sensitivity to the threat of stranger violence
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">(Phelan
et al., 2010)</xref>
        , predicts beliefs about men’s duty to protect
their spouses
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">(Saucier et  al., 2016)</xref>
        , and emphasizes
men’s responsibility to reduce violence toward women
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(Brownhalls et  al., 2021)</xref>
        . These findings suggest that
benevolent sexism signals safety from threats
originating outside of traditional heterosexual relationships.
However, this power dynamic allows the punitive
effects of benevolent to manifest within such
relationships. For example, benevolent sexism promotes
women’s acceptance of their partner’s autocratic behavior
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">(Moya et al., 2007)</xref>
        and predicts beliefs that normalize
men’s power over their partners
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(Chen et  al., 2009)</xref>
        .
Therefore, we argue benevolent sexism should foster
protection from outsiders but be punitive toward
intimate partners.

      <title>Sexism in Context</title>
      <p>
        A methodological reason for the mixed
protective/punitive effects of benevolent sexism is likely the
overrepresentation of WEIRD samples. Specifically, a key
feature of WEIRD contexts constrains both the
protective and punitive potential of benevolent sexism: lower
interdependence between men and women. First,
women are less dependent on men for protection
because there is less societal hostility. Research suggests
that the appeal of benevolent sexism is particularly
strong for women when perceived hostility is high
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref14">(Fischer, 2006; Glick et al., 2000)</xref>
        . This suggests that the
link with protective norms (i.e., opposition to violence)
would be weaker in the lower hostility contexts that
typify prior research.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, people in WEIRD contexts can more easily
dissolve unsatisfying relationships. Men who endorse
benevolent sexism are more willing to end relationships
because their partners violate their ideals
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Hammond
&amp; Overall, 2014)</xref>
        . But when social norms obstruct
divorce, perhaps men justify punitive violence—aimed
at aligning women’s behavior with sexist ideals—rather
than seeking another partner. Indeed, when countries
make divorce laws more permissive, domestic violence
falls dramatically
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(Brassiolo, 2016)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Reconciling the seemingly contradictory nature of
benevolent sexism requires moving beyond the WEIRD
world. A large probability sample in India affords us a
unique opportunity. The prevalence of hostility toward
women in India is relatively high, and norms against
dissolving unsatisfying relationships are strong
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref40">(Desai &amp;
Malhotra, 2018; Sreemol, 2018)</xref>
        . These social conditions—
prevalent across many non-WEIRD countries—should
allow the protective and punitive facets of benevolent
sexism to emerge. On the basis of our argument that
benevolent sexism connotes both antiviolence norms
(protection) and violence norms (punishment)
depending on the source of violence, we tested whether
benevolent sexism would be (a) negatively associated with
tolerance of outsider violence and (b) positively
associated with tolerance of spousal violence. In addition to
testing these two opposing associations, we also assessed
hostile sexism, which we expected to be positively related
to tolerance of both outsider and spousal violence,
consistent with its overt enforcement of men’s power

sample, a representative national sample, as part of the
Samaj Survey Project. In 2017, this sample consisted of
161,183 households (112,657 rural and 48,526 urban
households). Households were selected by dividing the
states and union territories of India into substate
“homogeneous regions”—sets of neighboring districts with
similar climatic conditions and urbanization levels—and
then randomly sampling villages/blocks of towns and
households within each region. Seven northeastern
states were excluded because they lie in mountainous
regions that are sparsely populated and difficult
to access: Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur,
Mizoram, Tripura, Meghalaya, and Sikkim. During
August and September 2017, interviewers attempted to
make face-to-face contact with each household. One
member of the household was asked to volunteer to
complete the verbally administered survey. In all,
134,531 people

Data for the current analysis were drawn from the
133,398 individuals (56,053 men and 77,345 women)
who provided complete responses to all measures used
in our model. Participants had a mean age of 44.26
years (SD = 13.41). Eighty-nine percent were literate,
95% were married, and 41% were in some form of
employment (with a further 48%, 7%, and 3% classifying
themselves as “homemakers,” retired, and students,
respectively). Eighty-five percent of the sample were
Hindu, 10% were Muslim, 3% were Sikh, and 1% were
Christian; the remaining 1% belonged to other religious
groups (e.g., Jain, Buddhist). Twenty-four percent of
the sample were from upper castes, 11% were from
intermediate castes, 39% were from Other Backward
Classes (OBCs), and 26% were from Scheduled Castes/
Scheduled Tribes (SCSTs). OBCs and SCSTs are official
classifications used by the Indian government for the
purposes of extending state assistance and
antidiscrimination protections to historically disadvantaged caste
groups
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">( Jodhka, 2012)</xref>
          . Thus, although the study was
representative of key demographics such as religion
and caste, women and people who were literate were
overrepresented.

        <title>Measures</title>
        <p>Survey characteristics. The large-scale nature of the
survey necessitated the use of very brief measures for all
variables in the model. For hostile sexism and
benevolent sexism, we had only three-item scales available.
These items were selected from pilot testing of sexism
items on a subsample of 1,510 people (drawn from the
same sampling frame as the main survey). We then took
the three highest loading items each, for hostile sexism
and benevolent sexism (see below). For tolerance of
outsider violence and spousal violence, we had only
singleitem measures available. These items were validated in a
separate study of 503 Indian people (see the
measurement validation study below).</p>
        <p>Validation analyses notwithstanding, short-form
scales have lower reliability, and their inclusion in our
analyses is an important caveat. Because of financial
limitations, we faced the standard trade-off between
measurement precision and large-scale representation
of a population, particularly a population as diverse
and physically dispersed as the Indian population (e.g.,
60% of the population is rural). Accordingly, our
approach prioritized measurement for 130,000 people
with these short scales for the insight it provided into
the gender attitudes of the world’s largest, yet
understudied, democracy.</p>
        <p>Items in the survey were first translated from English
into nine Indian languages (Hindi/Urdu, Marathi,
Punjabi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Odiya, and
Gujarati) and then independently back-translated to
ensure accuracy. Surveys were administered in
whichever language the participants were most comfortable
with (including English). The nature of how language
was implemented in the survey precluded formal tests
of measurement invariance across linguistic groups (for
a full discussion, see the Supplemental Material
available online). N. K. Sengupta and R. S. Malhotra were
involved in the initial data collection, in the role of
advisors on survey content, but all final decisions
regarding content and administration of the survey
were made by the Centre for the Monitoring of the
Indian Economy. Thus, no ethics approval was sought
or received from an institutional review board.
Nonetheless, the research followed established practices in
survey research and is thus consistent with the ethical
guidelines and legal requirements of the authors’
universities and complies with Indian law.</p>
        <p>
          Ambivalent sexism. Attitudes toward women were
assessed using six items from the Ambivalent Sexism
Inventory
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(Glick &amp; Fiske, 1996; scale from 1, strongly
disagree, to 5, strongly agree)</xref>
          . The three items measuring
hostile sexism were “Women are too easily offended,”
“Women seek to gain power by controlling men,” and “In
a fair competition, if women lose to men, they usually
complain about being discriminated against.” The three
items measuring benevolent sexism were “Women, as
compared to men, tend to have a more refined sense of
culture and good taste,” “Women should be cherished
and protected by men,” and “Women are naturally more
caring and empathetic than men.” Although our analyses
modeled variables as latent factors to adjust for
measurement reliability, Cronbach’s alphas for averaged hostile
sexism (α = .63) and benevolent sexism (α = .68)
indicated acceptable internal reliability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tolerance of outsider violence. Participants indicated
their agreement with the item “Women should accept
eve-teasing as a normal part of life” (scale from 1, strongly
disagree, to 5, strongly agree). “Eve-teasing” is a term
widely used in South Asia to refer to harassment and
assault perpetrated against women by strangers in public
spaces
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">(e.g., obscene remarks on the street or unwanted
groping on public transport; Talboys et al., 2017)</xref>
          .
Tolerance of spousal violence. Participants indicated
their agreement with the item “A husband has the right to
discipline his wife” (scale from 1, strongly disagree, to 5,
strongly agree). This item did not refer to explicit acts of
violence, but “discipline” connotes forms of physical and
psychological abuse, including verbal aggression,
humiliation, restriction of freedom, and economic abuse. All of
these possible types of discipline constitute spousal
violence as defined by the United Nations and under Indian
law. Thus, the concept of a husband disciplining his wife
constitutes spousal violence by local and international
standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          The inclusion of these two measures meant that we
clearly distinguish violence perpetrated by intimate
partners within the relational domain from violence
perpetrated by outsiders in the public domain (see also
“Measurement Validation Study” section below).
However, the required brevity of the questionnaire meant
we could not directly examine other forms of violence
that have been linked to sexism (e.g., explicit sexual
assault). For example, benevolent sexism is linked to
higher justification of sexual assault when the
perpetrator and victim are described as developing a romantic
connection, with the victim inviting the perpetrator into
her home (the “acquaintance-rape” condition)
compared with the perpetrator being a complete stranger
and following the victim in public
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref43">(the “stranger-rape”
condition; Abrams et  al., 2003; Viki et  al., 2004)</xref>
          . The
acquaintance-rape scenarios in prior research share
characteristics with tolerance of spousal violence in our
study (i.e., the implication that the perpetrator of
violence is involved romantically with the victim and that
violence occurs in a private setting). Thus,
notwithstanding the specificity of the current measures, our
model offers a framework for making predictions about
other forms of violence by considering the extent to
which they occur in a relational/private context versus
outside of it.

        <title>Measurement validation study</title>
        <p>
          To establish whether the single items for tolerance of
violence captured the underlying constructs they were
designed to assess, we conducted a separate
measurement validation study using an adult convenience
sample in India (n = 503). In this study, we included our
single-item measures along with multi-item scales
measuring tolerance of violence originating outside of
intimate relationships
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">(Illinois Sexual Harassment Myth
Acceptance Scale; Lonsway et al., 2008)</xref>
          and tolerance
of violence within intimate relationships
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">(Domestic
Violence Myths Scale; Peters, 2008)</xref>
          . These scales were
chosen because they come closest to the attitudinal
nature of our own constructs (as opposed to scales that
measure the direct commission or experience of
violence) and because they have been validated and used
extensively in prior research. The difference in content
between the two scales also captures the key distinction
in our study: violence originating from within versus
outside of the romantic relationship dyad.
        </p>
        <p>Full results of this study are presented in the
Supplemental Material. Results showed that (a) outsider
violence and spousal violence are distinct constructs, (b)
our focal items loaded onto their respective latent
constructs approximately as strongly as the typical item on
the long-form scales, and (c) our focal items did not
cross-load onto the undesignated latent construct (see
Tables S2 and S3 in the Supplemental Material). Overall,
these findings provide evidence that our items are
acceptable indices of two constructs previously
conceptualized to assess tolerance of violence that occurs
outside of romantic relationships (i.e., sexual
harassment) and tolerance of violence within romantic
relationships (i.e., domestic violence).</p>

          We did not conduct an a priori power analysis. Because
of the extremely large sample size, we determined that
there was adequate power to detect the hypothesized

        <title>Measurement model</title>
        <p>First, we examined the local fit of the measurement
model of the latent factors of hostile sexism and
benevolent sexism, each constrained to an intercept of 0 and
variance of 1, while freely estimating three
parameters—specifically, where Mplus modification indices
indicated that there may be residual item correlations
(i.e., items that share variance not shared with the latent
factor). The measurement model indicated strong and
significant loadings for all of the items on their
respective factors (βs = .514 to .681, SEs = .003 to .005, ps &lt;
.001) and a strong positive association between hostile
sexism and benevolent sexism (β = .715, SE = .005, p &lt;
.001). Indicators of the comparative fit index (CFI =
.946) and standardized root-mean-square residual
(SRMR = .035) both indicated good fit for the
measurement model, whereas the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI =
.838) and root-mean-square error of approximation
(RMSEA = .108) were both lower than criteria for good
fit (i.e., TLI &gt; .90 and RMSEA &lt; .08). We did not consider
the chi-square test of model fit (χ2 = 7727.967, p &lt; .001)
because it is too sensitive to the very large sample size.</p>
        <p>
          Altogether, we followed guidance to examine
indicators holistically and in the context of their theoretical
requirements
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27 ref28">(MacCallum &amp; Austin, 2000; Marsh et al.,
2004)</xref>
          and judged the overall fit for the measurement
model as acceptable. Specifically, two indicators were
good and two were lower than ideal, and our model
specification was based in theory that hostile sexism and
benevolent sexism are distinct, and positively related,
ideologies
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(Glick &amp; Fiske, 1996)</xref>
          . Thus, we had no
concerning evidence to indicate a lack of fit or problematic
degree of error to reject our measurement model.

      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-9-4">
        <title>Multigroup structural equation model</title>
        <p>We tested our hypotheses by simultaneously regressing
tolerance of outsider violence and tolerance of spousal
violence on latent hostile sexism and latent benevolent
sexism. Parameters for men and women were estimated
simultaneously in a multigroup model to facilitate
comparison of the latent slopes. The model provided a good
fit to the data, χ2(40) = 19451.104, p &lt; .001, SRMR =
.050, RMSEA = .085, 90% confidence interval (CI) =
[.084, .086], CFI = .901.</p>
        <p>Consistent with ambivalent sexism theory, latent
hostile sexism was positively associated with latent
benevolent sexism for both men, b = .441, SE = .005,
p &lt; .001, 99% CI = [.428, .455], and women, b = .375,
SE = .005, p &lt; .001, 99% CI = [.363, .386]. Accordingly,
we included these latent variables simultaneously in
the model to examine their unique patterns of
covariance with tolerance of violence against women. Overall,
the model for men explained 16.4% of the variance in
tolerance of outsider violence and 35.9% of the variance
in tolerance of spousal violence. The model for women
explained 16.4% of the variance in tolerance of outsider
violence and 30.9% of the variance in tolerance of
spousal violence.</p>
        <p>Endorsement of hostile sexism was related to greater
tolerance of outsider violence (Fig. 1), bmen = .905,
SE = .018, p &lt; .001, 99% CI = [.859, .952]; bwomen = .788,
SE = .012, p &lt; .001, 99% CI = [.758, .818]. Comparisons
of parameters between men and women in the
multigroup model indicated that this association was
stronger for men, parameter difference = .117, SE = .021, p &lt;
.001, 99% CI = [.064, .171]. Endorsement of hostile
sexism was also related to greater tolerance of spousal
violence, bmen = .184, SE = .013, p &lt; .001, 99% CI = [.152,
.217]; bwomen = .172, SE = .008, p &lt; .001, 99% CI = [.150,
.193]. There was no evidence that the effect was
significantly different by gender, parameter difference =
.013, SE = .015, p = .400, 99% CI = [−.026, .051]. Thus,
as hypothesized, endorsement of hostile sexism was
related to greater tolerance of violence against women
regardless of whether the source of that violence was
outsiders or women’s intimate partners.</p>
        <p>The pattern for benevolent sexism revealed the
hypothesized opposing effects on tolerance of outsider
violence versus spousal violence (Fig. 1). Endorsement
of benevolent sexism was related to lower tolerance of
outsider violence, bmen = −.381, SE = .016, p &lt; .001, 99%
CI = [−.422, −.340]; bwomen = −.336, SE = .009, p &lt; .001,
99% CI = [−.360, −.312]. This effect did not significantly
differ by gender according to our critical alpha,
parameter difference = −.045, SE = .018, p = .014, 99% CI =
[−.092, .002]. In contrast, endorsement of benevolent
sexism was related to higher tolerance of spousal
violence, bmen = .750, SE = .012, p &lt; .001, 99% CI = [.719,
.782]; bwomen = .686, SE = .008, p &lt; .001, 99% CI = [.667,
.706]. A comparison of the parameters indicated that
the link between latent benevolent sexism and
tolerance of spousal violence was slightly stronger for men
than for women, parameter difference = .064, SE = .014,
p &lt; .001, 99% CI = [.028, .100].</p>
        <p>Because hostile and benevolent sexism were both
positively related to tolerance of spousal violence, we
conducted an exploratory test of the differences in the
relative strength of these relationships. The coefficient
of benevolent sexism was significantly higher than the
coefficient of hostile sexism for both men, parameter
difference = .566, SE = .023, p &lt; .001, 99% CI = [.506,
.627], and women, parameter difference = .515, SE = .015,
p &lt; .001, 99% CI = [.477, .552]. Thus, endorsement of
benevolent sexism was related to even more tolerance
of spousal violence than endorsement of hostile sexism.
Results remained consistent when testing the model with
the inclusion of the following demographic covariates:
age, literacy, employment status, marital status, caste,
and religion (see the Supplemental Material).</p>

    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-10">
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>
        We conducted the first large-scale analysis of sexism
and tolerance of gender violence in India. As expected,
hostile sexism was related to greater tolerance of both
outsider violence and spousal violence
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(see Agadullina
et  al., 2022)</xref>
        , consistent with its function of directly
enforcing men’s power
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Bareket &amp; Fiske, 2023)</xref>
        . In
contrast, the results for benevolent sexism diverged from,
and provided an explanation for, null-to-weak effects
in prior research. Benevolent sexism was simultaneously
related to lower tolerance of outsider violence and
higher tolerance of spousal violence. The opposing
associations that differed on the basis of the source of
violence illustrate the context-specific harm of
benevolent sexism, consistent with its sensitivity to relational
gender-role norms
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Bareket &amp; Fiske, 2023)</xref>
        . Further,
effects emerged for both men and women, aligning with
theory that intergroup ideologies, including sexism, are
effective at structuring society because their
prescriptions are consensually shared by both high- and
lowstatus groups
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38 ref41">(Sengupta et al., 2017; Suppes, 2020)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>Our results provide new evidence for a central
proposition of ambivalent sexism theory: Hostile and
benevolent sexism have distinct consequences that
perpetuate men’s societal power. Hostile sexism reinforces
such power with overt aggression. By contrast,
benevolent sexism simultaneously entices women with offers
of safety while disempowering them with restrictive
expectations. We demonstrated that this dual nature of
benevolent sexism applies to violence. Any protection
from public violence that women gain from benevolent
sexism also means they are more vulnerable to violence
committed by their “protectors.” Its protective appeal
goes hand in hand with the disempowerment of women
within relationships.</p>
      <p>
        Although the disempowering effects of benevolent
sexism are well documented, the implications for
women’s power within relationships are underresearched
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Hammond &amp; Overall, 2017)</xref>
        . Indeed, norms of men’s
primacy in intimate relationships are weaker in WEIRD
contexts, in which sexism research is typically conducted
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(Chen et al., 2009)</xref>
        . Thus, prior research typically focused
on indirect forms of disempowerment
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">(e.g., benevolent
sexism undermining women’s career aspirations;
Kuchynka et al., 2017)</xref>
        . By going beyond WEIRD
contexts, our findings show that benevolent sexism is not
always subtle in bolstering gender inequality. It can
legitimize men’s power over women directly—at least
within the traditional relationships that are prevalent in
non-WEIRD societies such as India. Together with recent
evidence that a nation’s gender inequality may moderate
benevolent sexism’s effects on violence
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Agadullina
et  al., 2022)</xref>
        , these findings lay the groundwork for
understanding how sexism functions in non-WEIRD
contexts on the basis of the sociostructural conditions
prevalent in these contexts (e.g., a combination of higher
inequality and higher interdependence).
      </p>
      <p>A key strength of this study was its high
generalizability. Our large, representative sample indexed the
gender-related attitudes of a broad cross-section of the
Indian population—a diverse democratic society that
accounts for one sixth of humanity. High statistical
power also meant that our estimates of the hypothesized
associations were very precise. Nonetheless, the data
still come from a single country, and so more research
will be needed to confirm whether the findings
generalize to other non-WEIRD countries with different political
structures (e.g., nondemocracies), religious traditions
(e.g., Latin America), and histories of gender relations
(e.g., postcommunist societies). Moreover, the findings
are based on the specific questions posed to participants
in the current survey, and our analysis cannot speak to
forms of sexism (e.g., old-fashioned sexism) and
violence (e.g., rape) that were not measured here.</p>
      <p>
        Our cross-sectional survey precludes tests of the
directionality of associations. The rationale that sexist
attitudes precede violence norms follows prior theory
and research stating that sexist prescriptions for women
subsequently legitimize violence in response to
women’s deviations from those prescriptions
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref2">(Abrams et al.,
2003; Agadullina et al., 2022)</xref>
        . Nonetheless, ambivalent
sexism theory also recognizes that societal conditions,
including prevalence of violence, foster sexism
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref14">(Fischer,
2006; Glick et al., 2000)</xref>
        . Thus, sexist attitudes legitimize
gender inequality, but in turn, people’s experiences of
(dis)advantage foster beliefs that rationalize that
inequality. The current findings likely represent a
snapshot of a reciprocal process that can be tested in future
longitudinal research and do not imply that fixing
pervasive gender violence is as simple as changing
people’s attitudes.
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-11">
      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>We drew on ambivalent sexism theory to examine how
the pervasive violence faced by women in India is
tolerated. Results showed that understanding this problem
requires considering not only the hostile beliefs held
by men but also the combination of aggressive and
protective norms shared by both men and women.
Prescriptions that women should be protected from
outsiders can simultaneously legitimize men’s dominance
within relationships, thus reinforcing the very
inequalities that make women more vulnerable to violence.
