Do you think this person is overweight?<br />
Do you think this person takes care of themselves?<br />
Do you think this person is successful at work?<br />
Do you think this person has an attractive face?<br />
Do you think this person is clinically depressed? (manipulation check)<br />
Do you think this person is introverted or extroverted?<BR><BR><B>4) How many and which conditions will participants be assigned to?</B><BR>  Participants will be randomly assigned to one of six conditions, between-subjects, as two factors will be manipualated (target gender: male vs. female, and status: depressed vs. not depressed vs. control). first participants will be assigned to either the male or the female condition:<br />
Male condition:<br />
Jonathan Smith is a bank clerk at LMS, a bank in New Orleans, Louisiana. He is originally from Houston, Texas. Jonathan is 38, has a Associate Degree in Management, and is Caucasian. <br />
Female condition:<br />
Jessica Smith is a bank clerk at LMS, a bank in New Orleans, Louisiana. She is originally from Houston, Texas. Jessica is 38, has a Associate Degree in Management, and is Caucasian. <br />
Then, participants will be assigned to the depression condition, the nondepression condition, or the control condition. Participants in the control condition will proceed to the questions without reading any additional text.<br />
Participants in the depression condition will read this:<br />
This person is clinically depressed. They often have insomnia and are in a state of a really bad mood.<br />
Participants in the nondepression condition will read this:<br />
This person is not depressed. They have their up and downs like everyone, but are overall quite OK psychologically speaking.<BR><BR><B>5) Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/hypothesis.</B><BR>  We will conduct two-way ANOVAs with gender and condition as IVs and all the seven DVs.<BR><BR><B>6) Describe exactly how outliers will be defined and handled, and your precise rule(s) for excluding observations.</B><BR>  Participants who respond &quot;Yes&quot; to the question &quot;Have you ever been on the planet Jupiter?&quot; will be excluded from analyses.<BR><BR><B>7) How many observations will be collected or what will determine sample size?<BR><font size='2'> No need to justify decision, but be precise about <u>exactly</u> how the number will be determined.</font></B><BR>  800 Mturkers.<BR><BR><B>8) Anything else you would like to pre-register? <BR><font size='2'>(e.g., secondary analyses, variables collected for exploratory purposes, unusual analyses planned?)</font></B><BR>  <BR><BR><div style='text-align:right;font-size:70%;color:gray;'>Version of AsPredicted Questions: 2.00</div><center><div id='footer' style='margin-bottom:30px;' ><hr><a href='http://credlab.wharton.upenn.edu' target='_blank'><img src='https://aspredicted.org/images/CredLab Logo 2020_transparent.svg' width='165'></a><BR><BR><span style='font-size:small;'><a href='mailto:support@aspredicted.org?subject=I would like to report a bug'>Report a bug</a>  &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='mailto:support@aspredicted.org?subject=I have a suggestion for ResearchBox'>Make a suggestion</a>  &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='https://aspredicted.org/terms'>Terms of use</a>       &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='https://aspredicted.org/help'>Help</a>       &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='https://aspredicted.org/about'>About</a><BR><BR></center></div></div><script src='https://aspredicted.org/js/shared/main.js?version_date=1752905264' type='text/javascript'></script><script src='https://aspredicted.org/js/footer.js?version_date=1727788481' type='text/javascript'></script>
