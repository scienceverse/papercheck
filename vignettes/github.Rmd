There are some built-in functions in papercheck for exploring GitHub repositories. You can use these in custom modules.

## github_repo

The github functions all work with the following formats for referring to repositories:

* `"{username}/{repo}"`  
* `"{username}/{repo}.git"`  
* `"https://github.com/{username}/{repo}.git"`  
* `"https://github.com/{username}/{repo}/{...}"`  

The `github_repo()` function returns the simplified format of. repo name, and an error if the repository in inaccessible.

```{r}
github_repo("https://github.com/scienceverse/papercheck.git")
```

```{r, error = TRUE}
github_repo("scienceverse/checkpaper")
```


## github_readme

Get the text of the readme file, regardless of the exact file name (e.g., README vs README.md). 

```{r}
readme <- github_readme("scienceverse/papercheck")

cat(readme)
```



## github_languages

You can retrieve the number of bytes dedicated to various coding languages, as detected and classified by GitHub.

```{r}
github_languages("scienceverse/papercheck")
```

## github_files

You can get a list of file names, their path, size, file extension, and a guess at their type. 

By default, you just retrieve the files and directories in the base directory, non-recursively.

```{r}
github_files("scienceverse/papercheck")
```

```{r}
github_files("scienceverse/papercheck", dir = ".github")
```

You can also retrieve files recursively. Searching a large repository recursively can take a few seconds. 

```{r}
github_files("scienceverse/papercheck",
             dir = ".github",
             recursive = TRUE)
```

## github_info

Get all of the information about a repository in one list object, with items named "repo", "readme", "languages", and "files".

```{r}
info <- github_info("scienceverse/papercheck", 
                    recursive = TRUE)

info$files |> dplyr::count(type)
```
