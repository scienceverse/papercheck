\description{
This function uses a public grobid server maintained by Patrice Lopez. You can set up your own local grobid server following instructions from \url{https://grobid.readthedocs.io/} and set the argument \code{grobid_url} to its path (probably \url{http://localhost:8070})
}
\details{
Consolidation of citations, headers, and funders looks up these items in CrossRef or another database to fix or enhance information (see \url{https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Consolidation/}). This can slow down conversion. Consolidating headers is only useful for published papers, and can be set to 0 for work in prep.
