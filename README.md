The goal of papercheck is to automatically check scientific papers for
best practices.

## Installation

You can install the development version of papercheck from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("scienceverse/papercheck")
```

You can launch an interactive shiny app version of the code below with:

``` r
papercheck_app()
```

## Example

``` r
library(papercheck)
```

Convert a PDF to grobid XML format, then read it in as a scienceverse
paper object.

``` r
pdf <- demopdf() # use the path of your own PDF
grobid <- pdf2grobid(pdf)
paper <- read_grobid(grobid)
```

### Search Text

Search the returned text. The regex pattern below searches for text that
looks like statistical values (e.g., `N=313` or `p = 0.17`).

``` r
pattern <- "[a-zA-Z]\\S*\\s*(=|<)\\s*[0-9\\.-]*\\d"
text <- search_text(paper, pattern, 
                    return = "match", 
                    perl = TRUE)
```

| text            | section | header  | div |   p |   s | id                  |
|:----------------|:--------|:--------|----:|----:|----:|:--------------------|
| M = 9.12        | results | Results |   3 |   1 |   2 | to_err_is_human.xml |
| M = 10.9        | results | Results |   3 |   1 |   2 | to_err_is_human.xml |
| t(97.7) = 2.9   | results | Results |   3 |   1 |   2 | to_err_is_human.xml |
| p = 0.005       | results | Results |   3 |   1 |   2 | to_err_is_human.xml |
| M = 5.06        | results | Results |   3 |   2 |   1 | to_err_is_human.xml |
| M = 4.5         | results | Results |   3 |   2 |   1 | to_err_is_human.xml |
| t(97.2) = -1.96 | results | Results |   3 |   2 |   1 | to_err_is_human.xml |
| p = 0.052       | results | Results |   3 |   2 |   1 | to_err_is_human.xml |

### ChatGPT

You can ask ChatGPT to process text. Use `search_text()` first to narrow
down the text into what you want to query. Below, we returned the first
two papers’ introduction sections, and returned the full section. Then
we asked ChatGPT “What is the hypothesis of this study?”.

``` r
# ask chatGPT a question
hypotheses <- search_text(papers[1:2], 
                          section = "intro", 
                          return = "section")
query <- "What is the hypothesis of this study?"
gpt_hypo <- gpt(hypotheses, query)
```

| id           | answer                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |     cost |
|:-------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------:|
| eyecolor.xml | The hypothesis of this study is to test the sex-linked heritable preference hypothesis and the positive sexual imprinting hypothesis in relation to eye color and partner selection in heterosexual and same-sex couples. | 0.000671 |
| incest.xml   | The hypothesis of this study is that moral opposition to third-party sibling incest may be greater among individuals with other-sex siblings than among individuals who do not have other-sex siblings.                   | 0.000635 |

### Batch Processing

The functions `pdf2grobid()` and `read_grobid()` also work on a folder
of files, returning a list of XML file paths or paper objects,
respectively. The functions `search_text()` and `gpt()` also work on a
list of paper objects.

``` r
# read in all the XML files in the demo directory
grobid_dir <- demodir()
papers <- read_grobid(grobid_dir)

# select sentences in the intros containing the text "previous"
previous <- search_text(papers, "previous", 
                        section = "intro", 
                        return = "sentence")
```

| text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | section | header       | div |   p |   s | id         |

| Royzman et al’s non-replication potentially calls into question the reliability of previously reported links between having an other-sex sibling and moral opposition to third-party sibling incest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | intro   | Introduction |   1 |   3 |   3 | incest.xml |
| Previous research has shown that making cost-benefit analyses of using statistical approaches explicit can influence researchers’ attitudes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | intro   | \[div-01\]   |   1 |   8 |   5 | prereg.xml |
| When exploring difference in responses between previous experience with pre-registration, we see a clear trend where reasearchers who have pre-registered studies in their own research indicate pre-registration is more beneficial, and indicate higher a higher likelihood of pre-registering studies in the future, and higher percentage of studies for which they would consider pre-registering (see Table 2). | intro   | Attitude     |   3 |   7 |   1 | prereg.xml |

### Modules

Papercheck is designed modularly, so you can add modules to check for
anything. It comes with a set of pre-defined modules, and we hope people
will share more modules.

You can see the list of built-in modules with the function below.

``` r
module_list()
```

- ai-summarise: Generate a 1-sentence summary for each section
- all-p-values: List all p-values in the text, returning the matched
  text (e.g., ‘p = 0.04’) and document location in a table.
- all-urls: List all the URLs in the main text
- imprecise-p: List any p-values reported with insufficient precision
  (e.g., p \< .05 or p = n.s.)
- marginal: List all sentences that describe an effect as ‘marginally
  significant’.
- osf-check: List all OSF links and whether they are open, closed, or do
  not exist.
- ref-consistency: Check if all references are cited and all citations
  are referenced
- retractionwatch: Flag any cited papers in the RetractionWatch database
- sample-size-ml: Classify each sentence for whether it contains
  sample-size information.

To run a built-in module on a paper, you can reference it by name.

``` r
p <- module_run(paper, "all-p-values")
```

| text      | section | header  | div |   p |   s | id                  |
|:----------|:--------|:--------|----:|----:|----:|:--------------------|
| p = 0.005 | results | Results |   3 |   1 |   2 | to_err_is_human.xml |
| p = 0.052 | results | Results |   3 |   2 |   1 | to_err_is_human.xml |
| p \> .05  | results | Results |   3 |   2 |   2 | to_err_is_human.xml |

### Reports

You can generate a report from any set of modules. The default set is
`c("imprecise-p", "marginal", "osf-check", "retractionwatch", "ref-consistency")`

``` r
paper_path <- report(paper, output_format = "html")
```
