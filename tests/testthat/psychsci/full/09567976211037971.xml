<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Terms such as "Baby Boomer" or "Generation X" make us believe that people born at a specific time in history differ in ways that make each generation unique, describable, and predictable. The Big Five personality traits (conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, extraversion, and openness to experience) provide a well-established integrative framework that captures interindividual differences in human acting, feeling, and thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">( John et al., 2008)</ref> that are related to key life outcomes such as longevity, income, and happiness (Soto, 2019). However, beyond the college years, we know little about how personality differs across generational cohorts. Research has demonstrated that the Big Five traits evince distinct developmental trajectories across adulthood. For example, young adults invest efforts and resources into conventional social roles and thereby become more responsible and productive, as indexed by age-related increases in maturity-related traits (higher 1037971P SSXXX10.</p></div>

It remains an open question, though, whether the developmental trajectory of such personality characteristics is modulated by historical context. For example, is Generation X's conscientiousness increasing more rapidly than Baby Boomers' conscientiousness? This study used rich longitudinal data from multiple cohorts to examine whether and how age-related changes in Big Five personality traits in adulthood and old age differ across generations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Personality Characteristics and Historical Change</head><p>According to transactional models of human development <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baltes et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Roberts &amp; Nickel, 2017)</ref>, levels of functioning and change in individual characteristics are shaped by genetically mediated age-graded influences and sociohistorical contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Elder, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Schaie, 1965)</ref>. In the realm of personality, we argue that maturation and social investment jointly propel how society and the historical times people are living in shape personality characteristics in at least four important ways.</p><p>First, historically changing societal norms and expectations can alter what people value and desire, which then may lead to historical changes in social investments <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hülür, 2017)</ref>. For instance, later-born cohorts in Western societies are often characterized by more individualized goals than earlier-born cohorts <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Krings et al., 2008)</ref>. Given this shift, work-related goals such as the realization of one's own career might take priority over family goals. As a consequence, work-related traits might be particularly demanded and fostered. Especially for women, the significance of specific roles might have changed across time, and thus demands and opportunities for individuals to choose these roles have changed as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(George et al., 2011)</ref>. In line with this argument, it is likely that later-born cohorts show distinct levels of maturity-related traits. The first metaanalytic evidence indeed showed that later-born cohorts showed higher levels of perfectionism (one facet of conscientiousness) than earlier-born cohorts <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Curran &amp; Hill, 2019)</ref>. Similarly, between 1982 and 2007, levels of conscientiousness and agreeableness increased in same-age college freshmen, and levels of neuroticism decreased <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Smits et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Second, when societal circumstances change, the transition point into new social roles and necessary investments might also change. To illustrate, because people spend more years in formal education today <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Blair et al., 2005)</ref>, the transition points of job-market entry and of family formation are delayed <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arnett, 2000)</ref>. Such transitions are associated with changes in personality; for instance, conscientiousness increases when people enter the labor market <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Specht et al., 2011)</ref>. As a consequence, we assume that developmental trends in maturity-related personality traits are also shifted. For example, later-born cohorts show delayed increases in conscientiousness. Initial evidence in line with this expectation has been obtained in crosscultural research finding that maturity-related traits do indeed differ in accordance with adopted adult roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bleidorn et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Third, historical changes in perceived control can alter social-investment efforts across cohorts. Previous research has found that later-born cohorts report higher levels of internal control than earlier-born cohorts and maintain these higher levels into old age <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Drewelies et al., 2018)</ref>. Trusting one's own agency and believing that change is feasible are assumed to be prerequisites for self-regulated personality development <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hennecke et al., 2014)</ref>. Historical changes in control beliefs might thus enable later-born cohorts to invest into social roles more persistently than earlier-born cohorts, potentially resulting in higher levels of and steeper increases in the agency-related traits of extraversion and openness in later-born cohorts <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Du et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statement of Relevance</head><p>How people respond to, perceive, and think about their world changes with shifting environmental conditions, opportunity structures, and constraints, sometimes with substantial individual and societal consequences. Yet little is known about how personality traits-defined as individual differences in how people think, feel, and act-change with historical time, particularly after young adulthood. We investigated whether people born between 1883 and 1976 differ in how their personality traits develop as they move across adulthood. We found that later-born people were less agreeable and neurotic but more extraverted and open than their same-age, earlier-born peers. Later-born people also experienced steeper increases in agreeableness across time. Some of these cohort differences were related to historical changes in education and gender-related social roles. This work helps us better understand how societal change can shape what people need, value, and desire, and they refute overly generalized stereotypes that stigmatize people born at specific historical times.</p><p>Fourth, historical improvements in other key areas of life, such as health and cognitive functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gerstorf et al., 2011)</ref>, may open up more possibilities for adopting new roles, particularly later in life. To illustrate, empirical studies have found that good health buffers age-related increases in neuroticism and decreases in extraversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Wagner et al., 2016)</ref>. Scholars have argued that these late-life personality changes mirror people's adaptations to age-related losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mueller et al., 2017)</ref>. It is thus possible that the onset of health-related changes in personality is delayed among later-born cohorts because of historically improved health. Consistent with this possibility, research has shown that later-born cohorts of middle-age and older adults show higher levels of extraversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mroczek &amp; Spiro, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Twenge, 2001)</ref> and lower levels of neuroticism <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Terracciano et al., 2005)</ref>, as well as more pronounced old-age declines in neuroticism <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mroczek &amp; Spiro, 2003)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Research</head><p>We investigated cohort-related differences in personality trajectories across 50 years. First, we examined historical changes in trait levels, asking whether people from different cohorts differ, for instance, in how conscientious, agreeable, or extraverted they are. Second, we complemented this view by studying within-person developmental trajectories of personality traits to investigate cohort-related differences in trait change. Drawing on the four assumptions of sociohistorical changes outlined above, we hypothesized role-and time-shifted social-investment effects on historical change in Big Five traits: Later-born cohorts invest strongly in individualized, work-related goals, resulting in higher values in maturation-related traits. These differences might be more pronounced in women because of stronger shifts in female social roles over the past decades. Furthermore, we explored whether there are more pronounced cohort-related differences at some ages because of time-shifted social investment and stronger benefits from historical changes (i.e., in education and health). Regarding change patterns, we expected delayed but steeper changes in maturity-related traits (i.e., increases in conscientiousness and agreeableness) for later-born cohorts. We also expected higher levels and steeper increases of agency-related traits (extraversion and openness) in later-born cohorts. We furthermore explored whether these cohort-related differences in change trajectories are moderated by age.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Ethics approval for the study was granted by the University of Washington <ref type="bibr">(Budget No. 61-2960, electronic private access code [ePAC]</ref> No. PAC160797). The Seattle Longitudinal Study (SLS) data have been published previously in a great variety of research, primarily on adult intelligence development (see <ref type="bibr">Schaie, 2013, for an overview of this work)</ref>. No previous studies have used the Test of Behavioral Rigidity (TBR) scales of the SLS to study cohort effects in personality change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The SLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Schaie, 2013)</ref>, a long-running study of cognitive and psychosocial development, collected data from age-heterogenous longitudinal samples in the Seattle, Washington, metropolitan area every 7th year between <ref type="bibr">1956</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">and 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">. Personality was assessed in 1963</ref><ref type="bibr">, 1970</ref><ref type="bibr">, 1977</ref><ref type="bibr">, 1984</ref><ref type="bibr">, 1991</ref><ref type="bibr">, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2005</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">, and 2012</ref>. In total, 4,732 participants (age: M = 52.93 years, SD = 16.69; 53% female) provided 11,770 reports about their personality (the age distribution at baseline [from 19-91 years old] is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Data collection was restricted to the original participating population assessed at the first study wave. Overall, the sample was well educated, having an average of 14.17 years (SD = 3.25, range = 3-20) of formal education. Of the 4,732 participants included in this analysis, 2,606 provided data at two assessment waves, 1,750 at three waves, 1,222 at four waves, 743 at five waves, 413 at six waves, 222 at seven waves, and 117 at eight waves; 40 provided data at all nine assessment waves.</p><p>Selectivity analyses comparing individuals who completed two or more assessments (n = 2,606) with those who completed only one assessment (n = 2,126) showed that women participated more often than men (Cohen's d &lt; 0.10). Further, multiassessment participants had more years of formal education (d &lt; 0.50) and were more conscientious (d &lt; 0.15), agreeable (d &lt; 0.22), and open (d &lt; 0.39). Our results may thus not necessarily generalize to less positively selected, that is, less conscientious or educated, segments of the larger population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Personality traits. In the SLS, individuals' personality characteristics were repeatedly assessed using the TBR <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Schaie &amp; Parham, 1975)</ref>, a scale with 75 true/false items (e.g., "I am known as a hard and steady worker," "I don't like things to be uncertain and unpredictable"). Although the TBR and its three subscales are somewhat outdated and do not straightforwardly map to modern definitions of personality, the repeated measures provide a rich resource for examining longitudinal change in personality. Making use of this unique resource, we identified a subset of items from the original TBR scales that do map onto the well-established and frequently studied Big Five taxonomy. Because a Big Five scale, the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO-PI-R; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992)</ref>, was included in the SLS in 2005, we were able to do the mapping in an empirical way by examining how responses to TBR items were correlated with the NEO-PI-R scales. The 21 TBR items shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> had the highest correlations and provided a reasonable basis for measurement of the Big Five traits in the nine-wave data. The TBR measured agreeableness with five items, openness with five items, extraversion and conscientiousness with four items each, and neuroticism with three items. Similar to previous studies using short inventories on the broad personality constructs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brandt et al., 2020)</ref>, internal consistencies indicated broad representation of each construct <ref type="bibr">(ωs = .52, .40, .38, .44, and .56 for conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, extraversion, and openness, respectively)</ref>. Correlations between the newly built TBR-based personality scales and the NEO domains were substantial at both the latent construct and manifest levels, ranging between .72 for agreeableness and openness and .93 for conscientiousness (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Additional correlational patterns are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S2</ref> and in the heat maps in Figures S1 to S5 in the supplementary materials (available at <ref type="url" target="https://osf.io/px57h/">https://osf.io/px57h/</ref>). At the item level, the heat maps show that facet correlations within the NEO-PI-R scale are slightly stronger than item correlations within the TBR-based scale, but overall they clearly support the use of the newly built measurement-invariant scales (calculated as sum scores for each of the Big Five personality dimensions) in the longitudinal analysis (in the supplementary materials, see also Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> for correlations on scale levels and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S3</ref> for measurementinvariance testing). For analysis, scores on each dimension were converted to T scores (M = 50, SD = 10) based on all observations. Time in study, age-related differences, and cohort effects. Following previous researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gerstorf et al., 2019)</ref>, we created three variables to assess intraindividual change, age-related differences in levels and change, and cohort-related differences in levels and change. First, intraindividual change was modeled using a person-specific time-varying time-in-study variable that captured the number of years since each individual's</p><p>0 20 40 60 80 20 40 60 80 Chronological Age (Years)</p><p>Frequency <ref type="bibr">1883-1913 1914-1944 1945-1976</ref> Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Frequency of chronological age at each individual's baseline. .22 <ref type="bibr">[.16, .27]</ref> Note: The original item format was 1 for true and 2 for false. All positively formulated items were recoded so that higher values reflect higher scores on the personality trait. The TBR scale consists of three subscales-a Rigidity scale (RS), a Social Responsibility (SR) scale, and a Perseverative Behavior (PB) scale. The original assignments of selected TBR items to these three subscales are presented in brackets. In the correlation column, values in brackets are 95% confidence intervals.</p><p>baseline assessment, recentered at the midpoint of each individual's time series, and divided by 7 to match the 7-year interval between successive waves in the SLS design. Second, age-related differences were modeled using a time-invariant variable, chronological age at the midpoint assessment, centered at the average age of the sample (58 years). Third, cohort-related differences were modeled using a time-invariant variable, birth year, centered at the average year of birth in the sample <ref type="bibr">(1926)</ref>. Of note, statistical analyses were done using year of birth as a continuous variable. However, for illustration purposes in our graphical representations, we display trajectories for three artificial cohort groups by dividing the range of birth years in three equally distanced groups (those born between <ref type="bibr">1883 and 1913, between 1914 and 1944, and between 1945 and 1976)</ref>.</p><p>Covariates. Covariates were sex (coded as 0 = male, 1 = female) and years of education (coded as the number of years that were necessary for obtaining the final school degree), both of which were sample-mean centered for ease of interpretation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytic strategy</head><p>We used separate growth models <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Grimm et al., 2016)</ref> for each Big Five dimension to study intraindividual change, age-related differences, and cohort-related differences in levels of personality and change in personality, as follows (illustrated for extraversion):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">extraversion time in study time in study ti i i ti i t i = + ( ) + β β β 0 1 2 2 2 ( ) + e ti ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where person i's score on a given personality trait at observation t, extraversion ti , is modeled as a function of a person-specific intercept coefficient, β 0i ; a personspecific linear slope coefficient, β 1i ; a person-specific quadratic slope coefficient, β 2i ; and residual error, e ti .</p><p>Individual differences in the person-specific coefficients were modeled as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">β γ γ γ γ 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 03 i i i i i u = + + + × + ( ) ( ) ( ) age b irth year birth year age 0 0i ,<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">β γ γ γ γ 1 1 0 1 1 1 2 13 i i i i i u = + + + × + ( ) ( ) ( ) age b irth year birth year age 1 1i , and<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">β 2i = g 20 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where gs are sample-level parameters describing how a personality trait differs with age, year of birth, and their interaction, and u i 0 and u i 1 are unexplained individual differences that are assumed to be multivariate and normally distributed with standard deviations, σ u0 and σ u1 and correlation r u u 0 1 . Models were constructed in three steps. First, we modeled the intraindividual change trajectory and age gradients (Model 1). Second, we included birth year as a predictor in Equations 2 and 3 to investigate cohort effects (Model 2). Third, we included the additional covariates sex and education (Model 3). Final models were trimmed for parsimony of presentation. Significance was evaluated at an α level of .01.</p><p>All models were estimated using the lme4 package (Version 1.1-23; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bates et al., 2015)</ref> in the R environment (Version 4.0.2; R Core Team, 2020) using full-information maximum-likelihood procedures that accommodated incomplete data under missing-at-random assumptions. All analysis code has been made publicly available on OSF (<ref type="url" target="https://osf.io/s8zk5/">https://osf.io/s8zk5/</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Descriptive statistics and intercorrelations among the measures of interest (in 2005) are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. In line with previous findings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Löckenhoff et al., 2014)</ref>, our results showed that women, on average, had higher levels of agreeableness and lower levels of extraversion than men but, contrary to prior findings, had slightly lower levels of neuroticism than men. Also in line with previous findings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Poropat, 2009)</ref>, results showed that more time in formal education was associated with higher levels of openness. Greater age was associated with higher conscientiousness and agreeableness and with lower extraversion and openness. Overall, these findings fit very well with previous reports based on more established Big Five inventories, indicating that the newly built TBR-based personality scales worked as expected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Developmental trajectories and age gradients of personality traits</head><p>Results from Model 1 are summarized in the upper portion of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. On average, older participants had higher levels of conscientiousness (g 01 = 0.072, p &lt; .001), agreeableness (g 01 = 0.141, p &lt; .001), and neuroticism (g 01 = 0.037, p &lt; .001) and lower levels of extraversion (g 01 = -0.048, p &lt; .001) and openness (g 01 = -0.170, p &lt; .001) than younger participants.</p><p>For the prototypical individual in the sample, four of the five Big Five personality traits (the exception being extraversion) exhibited change across the waves of the study. Specifically, conscientiousness (g 10 = 0.421, p &lt; .001) and agreeableness (g 10 = 0.613, p &lt; .001) increased over time in study, whereas neuroticism (g 10 = -0.623, p &lt; .001) and openness (g 10 = -0.224, p &lt; .001) decreased over time in study. The extent of decrease was moderated by age: Older individuals exhibited shallower decreases in neuroticism (g 11 = 0.024, p &lt; .01) and steeper decreases in openness (g 11 = -0.026, p &lt; .001).</p><p>Consistent with established differences and trends <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bleidorn et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Roberts et al., 2006)</ref>, results showed that maturity-related traits exhibited within-person increases in conscientiousness and agreeableness and decreases in neuroticism, whereas agency-related traits (openness) decreased across time.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cohort-related differences in developmental trajectories of personality traits</head><p>Results from Model 2, which additionally allowed for cohort-related differences in personality change, are presented in the lower portion of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. Results indicated substantial cohort-related differences in all personality traits but conscientiousness. Later-born cohorts had lower levels (at age 58 years) of agreeableness (g 02 = -0.045, p &lt; .001) and neuroticism (g 02 = -0.192, p &lt; .001) than earlierborn cohorts and higher levels (at age 58 years) of extraversion (g 02 = 0.108, p &lt; .001) and openness (g 02 = 0.233, p &lt; .001). There were also cohort-related differences in how agreeableness changed over time in study. Laterborn cohorts exhibited steeper increases in agreeableness across time than earlier-born cohorts (g 12 = 0.011, p &lt; .01). For some personality traits, the age gradients also differed across cohorts. Later-born cohorts exhibited steeper age-related decreases in neuroticism (g 03 = -0.002, p &lt; .001) and age-related increases (rather than agerelated decreases) in agreeableness (g 03 = 0.002, p &lt; .001) and openness (g 03 = 0.003, p &lt; .001).

Looking specifically at the trajectories for agreeableness, we see that later-born cohorts had overall lower levels of agreeableness than earlier-born cohorts (solid black lines), that the age gradient increased more steeply for the later-born cohort (long, thin lines), and that all cohorts showed intraindividual change across time in study (dashed short line pointing upward in younger adulthood and downward in older adulthood). In complement, looking at the trajectories for openness, we see that later-born participants reported higher average levels of openness and that this effect was more pronounced for older than for younger participants.</p><p>Following standard practice in multilevel modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Snijders &amp; Bosker, 2012)</ref>, we calculated the relative reduction of unexplained (residual) variance in levels and rates of change between a model that estimated age effects only (Model 1) and a model that estimated both age and cohort effects simultaneously. To illustrate, we took the residual variance (at Level 2 for intercepts, Level 2 for slopes) of Model 1 (e.g., neuroticism: 52.345 from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>) minus the residual variance of Model 2 (e.g., neuroticism: 44.673) divided by the residual variance of Model 1 (e.g., neuroticism: 52.345) to determine that the birth-year variable reduced unexplained variance by 14.7%. Overall, birth year accounted for between nearly 0% and 15% of the variance in level and rates of within-person change in personality (small effect sizes); the largest effects were obtained for neuroticism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sex and education as explanatory covariates</head><p>In a final step, we included sex and education as additional predictors that might explain some of the differences. Results shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> were quite comparable with those above except for three effects. First, the age gradient for level of extraversion was no longer significant when models accounted for the covariates. Second, a significant interaction effect between birth year and sex was observed for conscientiousness (g 04 = 0.049, p &lt; .001), indicating that later-born women, but not men, reported higher levels of conscientiousness than earlier-born women. We furthermore found a significant interaction effect between birth year and sex in neuroticism; later-born women again reported higher levels of neuroticism than men (g 04 = 0.040, p &lt; .01). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> illustrates the developmental trajectories of personality traits for different cohorts as implied by the conditional models. Overall, it appears that the covariates (sex and education) attenuated the cohort-related differences, suggesting that some of the cohort differences were related to historical changes in education and genderrelated social roles. Including the covariates resulted in a greater reduction of unexplained variance between Model 1 and Model 3, particularly regarding agreeableness and openness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We investigated whether people born at a specific time in history differ on average in how they act, feel, and think from same-age people who were born earlier or later-an assumption held by society and life-span theory alike (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baltes et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Elder, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Schaie, 1965)</ref>. Our results provide evidence for historical changes in levels and to some extent also in developmental trajectories of personality traits. We discuss our results, noting the similarities and differences among maturity-related traits and agency-related traits, and also highlight that the age differences observed for many of these historical changes are in line with propositions on the adaptive role of maturation and social investment across human ontogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mueller et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Roberts &amp; Nickel, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Three key findings stand out from our results of cohort-related differences in Big Five personality. First, later-born cohorts showed lower levels of agreeableness and neuroticism and higher levels of extraversion. Although findings of neuroticism were in line with our expectations, those for conscientiousness were only partly so: Women, but not men, reported higher levels of conscientiousness among later-born cohorts, which points to stronger changes in social roles across cohorts for women than for men. The relative importance of work-related goals, such as the realization of one's own career and family goals, might have changed across cohorts, particularly for women. This is also supported by the finding that later-born women participate more in the labor force than earlier-born women <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">( Juhn &amp; Potter, 2006)</ref>. Increases in extraversion as an agencyrelated trait might be related to the established finding of more perceived control in later-born cohorts. This nicely aligns with the argument that there is a stronger likelihood of change when one believes in its feasibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hennecke et al., 2014)</ref>. Our findings of historical changes in maturity-related traits are consistent with reports of historical improvements of living conditions and with changes in what people value and desire. By contrast, our results on historical changes in agencyrelated traits map onto reports of historical increases in perceived control. We also note that our findings of lower levels of agreeableness among later-born cohorts are at odds with the findings reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Smits et al. (2011)</ref>. The different samples (American citizens on average in their late 50 vs. Dutch college freshmen) and measures might disclose age-related or cultural differences in cohort effects. In terms of culture, differences between countries in transitions to the labor force were found to be strongly associated with different maturation patterns across countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bleidorn et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chopik &amp; Kitayama, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Second, several of the historical changes were moderated by age. In line with our expectation, it appears that later-born cohorts start to invest later in age-graded social roles and thus report lower levels in agreeableness than earlier-born cohorts in young adulthood. Prolonged education times that result in later job entries appear to delay increases in agreeableness <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bleidorn et al., 2013)</ref>. But once job life has started, investments appear to be amplified, as depicted by steeper age-related increases in agreeableness and decreases in neuroticism in laterborn cohorts. Later in life, social-role transitions and expectations are less clear <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Freund et al., 2009)</ref>, possibly leading to fewer maturity-related differences. Contrary to our expectation, our results also showed that cohortrelated differences in openness were more pronounced among older adults. For such agency-related traits, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Freund et al. (2009)</ref> suggested that self-regulation is particularly relevant in late life, which explains the larger differences in levels of these traits at older ages.</p><p>Third, evidence regarding cohort-related differences in developmental trajectories was weak; only withinperson increases in agreeableness were more pronounced in later-born cohorts. Later-born cohorts <ref type="bibr">Born 1945</ref><ref type="bibr">-1976</ref><ref type="bibr">Born 1914</ref><ref type="bibr">-1944</ref><ref type="bibr">Born 1883</ref><ref type="bibr">-1913</ref><ref type="bibr">Born 1945</ref><ref type="bibr">-1976</ref><ref type="bibr">Born 1883</ref><ref type="bibr">-1913</ref><ref type="bibr">Born 1914</ref><ref type="bibr">-1944</ref><ref type="bibr">Born 1945</ref><ref type="bibr">-1976</ref><ref type="bibr">Born 1883</ref><ref type="bibr">-1913</ref><ref type="bibr">Born 1914</ref><ref type="bibr">-1944</ref><ref type="bibr">Born 1945</ref><ref type="bibr">-1976</ref><ref type="bibr">Born 1914</ref><ref type="bibr">-1944</ref><ref type="bibr">Born 1883</ref><ref type="bibr">-1913</ref><ref type="bibr">Born 1945</ref><ref type="bibr">-1976</ref><ref type="bibr">Born 1883</ref><ref type="bibr">-1913</ref><ref type="bibr">Born 1914</ref><ref type="bibr">-1944</ref><ref type="bibr">Born 1945</ref><ref type="bibr">-1976</ref><ref type="bibr">Born 1914</ref><ref type="bibr">-1944</ref><ref type="bibr">Born 1883</ref><ref type="bibr">-1913</ref> Agreeableness  <ref type="bibr">1,405; born between 1914-1944: n = 2,386; born between 1945-1976</ref>: n = 941).

Additionally, at the end of life, the differences between cohorts seem to become smaller. At the same time, one might ask why we have not found more evidence for cohort-related differences in within-person trajectories of the Big Five. It seems that time-shifted social investment comes with differences in the levels of maturity-related traits across cohorts but not with differences in the rates at which these traits change.</p><p>Although cohort-related differences became smaller at older ages, later-born cohorts do not catch up with earlier-born cohorts. Because education times are longer in later-born cohorts, time for work and family goals is compressed into the rush hour of young to middle adulthood. Thus, people are not able to maximize their investment into these goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Freund, 2020)</ref> or need to divide their investment into several roles (child care and work; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Evandrou &amp; Glaser, 2004)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strength, limitations, and outlook</head><p>Despite the strengths of a large longitudinal data set covering 50 years of assessment, several limitations need further attention. First, the long-term personality assessments were conducted using an outdated measure (additional NEO-PI-R measures were included in 2005). The mapping between these old items and the frequently studied Big Five taxonomy showed high convergence, but we might not have captured the whole breadth of the original NEO-item content (e.g., neuroticism lacks content such as anxiety and depression, openness is based primarily on nontraditionalism). Because differences in developmental patterns can already be observed when different Big Five inventories are used <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Graham et al., 2020)</ref>, deviations from previous studies may also result from differences in how personality is operationally defined. It is thus pivotal for future research to test the robustness and generalizability of our findings. Relatedly, although we provide code that allows for an analytical replication of results, a lack of comparable data sets limits the experimental replication of results.</p><p>Second, although we cover a large age range, other developmentally interesting periods, such as adolescence or very old age, are not represented in our sample. Specifically, most information was available for midlife, limiting the generalizability of our findings and suggesting the need for an investigation of the onset of cohort-related differences. Potentially, cohort-related differences in personality levels in adulthood might emerge because of differential change trajectories in younger ages. Because differential change trajectories between cohorts are assumed to be shaped by the sociohistorical context in which development takes place, the generalizability of our findings to countries other than the United States needs to be further explored.</p><p>Finally, our study provided the first evidence for the propositions that joint efforts of maturation and social investment <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Roberts &amp; Nickel, 2017)</ref> help us to understand how society and historical times can shape personality characteristics. Future studies should test these assumptions more directly either by linking the experiences people make in their daily lives to personality development or by asking for the individual values and desires that potentially guide their investments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Do generations really differ in how they generally act, feel, and think, and do they develop differentially across the life span? The answer is mixed. People born at different times indeed differ, on average, in how conscientious, agreeable, neurotic, extraverted, and open they are. These differences were more pronounced in younger than older people for maturity-related traits, but the opposite was true for agency-related traits. We found little evidence that the rates by which personality changes differ across historical times. Our results yielded initial evidence for cohort-related differences in levels of Big Five personality characteristics that point to delayed social-investment and maturity effects in later-born adults compared with those born earlier.</p></div>
