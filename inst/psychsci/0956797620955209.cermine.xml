      <abstract>
        <p>The tendency to attend to and avoid cues to pathogens varies across individuals and contexts. Researchers have proposed that this variation is partially driven by immunological vulnerability to infection, though support for this hypothesis is equivocal. One key piece of evidence (Miller &amp; Maner, 2011) shows that participants who have recently been ill-and hence may have a reduced ability to combat subsequent infection-allocate more attention to faces with infectious-disease cues than do participants who have not recently been ill. The current article describes a direct replication of this study using a sample of 402 individuals from the University of Michigan, the University of Glasgow, and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam-more than 4 times the sample size of the original study. No effect of illness recency on attentional bias for disfigured faces emerged. Though it did not support the original finding, this replication provides suggestions for future research on the psychological underpinnings of pathogen avoidance.</p>

      <p>
        Across taxa, animals possess a number of behavioral
adaptations that function to mitigate the costs imposed
by infectious microorganisms
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(Hart, 2011)</xref>
        . Humans are
no exception. For example, our visual and olfactory
systems have evolved a sensitivity to cues related to
infectious agents, such as the textures and colors
associated with other people’s immune responses (e.g., pus)
and the chemical by-products of bacterial presence on
corpses (e.g., putrescine). When these cues to
pathogens are detected, facial movements and motivational
tendencies are deployed in a manner tailored to
avoiding pathogens
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">(Tybur, Lieberman, Kurzban, &amp; DeScioli,
2013)</xref>
        . Our pathogen-avoidance adaptations have
consequences for myriad phenomena traditionally under the
purview of social, developmental, cognitive, and clinical
psychologists, including food learning, stigmatization,
hygiene ruminations, and mate choice
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2 ref23 ref27 ref32 ref33 ref4">(for reviews, see
Ackerman, Hill, &amp; Murray, 2018; Curtis, 2014; Murray &amp;
Schaller, 2016; Schaller &amp; Park, 2011; and Tybur &amp;
Lieberman, 2016)</xref>
        . Consequently, a large body of research—
what has come to be known as the
behavioral-immunesystem literature—has focused on better understanding
these adaptations.
      </p>
      <p>
        A sizeable proportion of work on the behavioral
immune system has been designed to better
understand why people vary in their pathogen-avoidant
behaviors. Much of this research has been inspired by
the evolutionary-biology literature, which highlights the
fact that organisms neutralize pathogens not only
through avoidance but also through immunological
resistance (e.g., via proinflammatory cytokines) and
tolerance
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(Medzhitov, Schneider, &amp; Soares, 2012)</xref>
        . Given
that investment in these strategies might be traded off
against each other
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Gangestad &amp; Grebe, 2014)</xref>
        ,
researchers have proposed that a decreased ability to resist
infection leads to greater investment in avoiding
infection
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref9">(e.g., Oaten, Stevenson, &amp; Case, 2009)</xref>
        . Multiple
studies have presented data that have been interpreted
as supporting this prediction: Putatively lower
immunological resistance was associated with (a) greater skin
conductance response while participants viewed visual
cues to pathogens
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(Ersche et  al., 2014)</xref>
        , (b) higher
reported disgust toward such images
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(Fleischman &amp;
Fessler, 2011)</xref>
        , and (c) more reported anxiety toward
infection-risky behaviors
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">(Oaten, Stevenson, &amp; Case,
2017)</xref>
        . These studies were limited by their measurement
of capacity to resist infection, however; they treated
cocaine dependency, progesterone, and affliction with
rheumatoid arthritis, respectively, as proxies for decreased
immunological resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the best of our knowledge, the most compelling
evidence for a relation between immunological
resistance and pathogen avoidance in humans was provided
by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">Miller and Maner (2011)</xref>
        , who, in Study 1, found that
participants who had recently been ill—compared with
participants who had not—displayed heightened
attention toward cues to pathogens. Specifically, participants
completed a dot-probe task, in which they were asked
to identify a target object as either a circle or a square
as quickly as possible. In critical trials, faces that were
either typical (referred to as “healthy” in the original
study) or disfigured appeared shortly before the target
object in a different screen quadrant. Higher reaction
times during these critical trials were interpreted as
reflecting greater attention toward the distractors.
Analyses of reaction times revealed that illness recency
interacted with distractor type: The 28 participants who
had recently been ill took 38 ms longer to identify the
targets after disfigured-face distractors relative to
typicalface distractors (SD = 65.25, dz = 0.58), whereas reaction
times did not differ across distractor face types for the
66 participants who had not recently been ill
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2 ref20 ref30">(mean
difference = 4 ms faster to identify targets after
disfiguredface distractors, SD = 58.32, dz = 0.07; J. K. Maner,
personal communication, April 25, 2018)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of illness recency to test
behavioral-immunesystem hypotheses offers a clear advantage over the
other approaches described above. Illness recency is
presumably less confounded with other variables than
are cocaine dependency or rheumatoid arthritis, and it
has clearer effects on immunological resistance than
does progesterone. Indeed, immunologists have noted
that people are more likely to die of secondary bacterial
infections after influenza than from the viral infection
itself, and research exploring this phenomenon has
found that resisting influenza raises anti-inflammatory
interleukin-10 and depresses natural killer cells
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29 ref36">(Small
et al., 2010; Van der Sluijs, 2004)</xref>
        . Both of these effects
compromise the ability to resist subsequent infections.
      </p>
      <p>
        The finding that illness recency affects attention to
pathogen cues has influenced theoretical models of the
behavioral immune system
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2 ref23 ref32 ref33">(e.g., Ackerman et al., 2018;
Murray &amp; Schaller, 2016; Tybur &amp; Lieberman, 2016)</xref>
        , and
it has been showcased as a key example of the relation
between immunological resistance and the behavioral
immune system
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref17 ref18">(e.g., Fleischman &amp; Fessler, 2018; cf.
Jones et  al., 2018b)</xref>
        . The current study directly
replicated Study 1 of
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">Miller and Maner (2011)</xref>
        to test the
robustness of the effect of illness recency on attention
to pathogen cues. It had an additional goal.
Disgustsensitivity instruments, in which participants report their
disgust toward disgust-eliciting situations, have been
criticized as potentially insensitive to short-term
fluctuations in pathogen-avoidance motivations
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref30">(Fleischman &amp;
Fessler, 2018; Tybur, Çınar, Karinen, &amp; Perone, 2018)</xref>
        .
Self-reported disgust toward visual cues to pathogens
has been proposed as a more sensitive measure of such
fluctuations
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Fleischman &amp; Fessler, 2018)</xref>
        . Therefore, we
also assessed whether scores on a disgust-sensitivity
instrument and self-reported disgust toward visual cues
to pathogens are related to illness recency. Note that we
administered these additional measures, which were not
included by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">Miller and Maner (2011)</xref>
        , after the materials
collected in the original study. Consequently, their
presence did not interfere with the replication.
      </p>
      <p>
        This replication attempt comes at a critical time for
the behavioral-immune-system literature. Although the
studies summarized above have pointed to a relation
between immunological resistance and avoidance,
others have found no relation between progesterone and
disgust sensitivity
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref18 ref20">( Jones et al., 2018a)</xref>
        , infection history
and disgust sensitivity
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4 ref6">(de Barra, Islam, &amp; Curtis, 2014)</xref>
        ,
and ecological pathogen stress and disgust sensitivity
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32 ref33">(Tybur et  al., 2016)</xref>
        . These studies used large samples
(all had more than 280 participants, which would afford
more than 90% power to detect an effect size [r] of .20
for a between-subjects design), and Jones et al. also
collected repeated assessments of progesterone and
disgust sensitivity within participants. Hence, these null
results cannot easily be dismissed as Type II errors.
Ultimately, given the combination of positive and null
results, some doubts regarding the relation between
immunological resistance and pathogen avoidance
persist. Hence, replicating one of the key results supporting
this relation could pay dividends in future theory
development in this area. Further, measuring both attention
to pathogen cues and disgust sensitivity indicates
whether inconsistent results within this literature reflect
differences in phenomena measured (e.g., visual
attention vs. disgust sensitivity).
      </p>
      <p>Ultimately, then, the present work (a) directly
replicates a key study in the behavioral-immune-system
literature and, in doing so, (b) informs the degree to
which illness recency relates to visual attention to
pathogen cues versus self-reported disgust (via
semantic and visual descriptions) toward stimuli connoting
heightened infection risk.</p>

        Except where noted, all methodological details—including
all stimuli and dot-probe procedures—and all analyses
were identical to those used by Miller and Maner (2011,

          tested 96 participants (all
between 18 and 30 years of age). Simonsohn’s (2015)
“small-telescopes” approach to sample size suggests
that replications should have at least 2.5 times the
sample size of the original study (hence, a replication
sample size of 240). Given the potential of randomly
recruiting a lower proportion of recently ill participants
(relative to the sample in the original study), we
preregistered a sample size of 360 participants. We
ultimately enrolled 413 participants between the ages of
18 and 30 years across the three test sites (n = 147 at
Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, n = 145 at the University
of Michigan, and n = 121 at the University of Glasgow).
According to an analysis in G*Power
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(Version 3.9.1.7;
Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, &amp; Lang, 2009)</xref>
          , this sample
size affords more than 99% power to detect an
interaction effect (d) of 0.65 (equivalent to that reported in
the original study). This calculation was based on an
exclusion rate of 2% (see below), categorization of 30%
of the sample as recently ill (i.e., 121 participants who
had recently been ill and 283 participants who had not),
and setting α to .025 (see below). Given evidence that
experimenters’ expectations can influence results
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(Gilder &amp; Heerey, 2018)</xref>

        <p>We used a dot-probe task, experimental setup, and
code identical to those used in the original study. On
each trial, a face was displayed in one quadrant of the
computer screen. After 500 ms, the face disappeared, and
a categorization object (circle or square) was immediately
presented in either the same location as the face
(congruentlocation trials) or a different quadrant
(incongruentlocation trials). Participants were instructed to respond as
quickly as possible by categorizing the object as a circle
(via the E key) or a square (via the I key). Each
participant completed 80 trials in total (32 congruent-location
trials and 48 incongruent-location trials). Each of the 40
faces (20 disfigured, 20 nondisfigured) was presented
twice. Participants also completed 12 practice trials
before completing those with faces. For these practice
trials, items intended to be neutrally valenced and not
associated with threats (infectious disease or otherwise;
e.g., a mug, a pair of shoes, a spoon) were presented
instead of faces.</p>
        <p>Quadrant locations of faces and categorization
objects were randomized, as were categorization-object
shape and face types. These locations and shapes were
constrained so that 32 trials used congruent locations
and 48 trials used incongruent locations. As soon as the
participant responded, the next trial started (i.e., the
face in the next trial was presented immediately, and
there was no intertrial interval). Trial order was
randomized within each of the four blocks of trials.</p>
        <p>Faces and categorization objects were presented at
20% of screen height, centered at 15% of screen height

      <sec id="sec-2-4">
        <title>Questionnaires</title>
        <p>Self-report instruments were presented after the
dotprobe task via Qualtrics surveys. Illness recency was
assessed using both categorical and continuous
measures. For the categorical measure, participants reported
the last time they had a cold by choosing from the
options “today,” “a couple days ago,” “a week ago,” “a
couple weeks ago,” “a month ago,” “a few months ago,”
or “a year or more ago.” Participants responding “today,”
“a couple days ago,” or “a week ago” were categorized
as recently ill, and all others were categorized as not
recently ill.</p>
        <p>
          For the continuous measure, participants responded
to four statements on a 7-point scale (1 = strongly
disagree, 7 = strongly agree): “Over the past couple of days,
I have not been feeling well”; “Lately, I have been
feeling a little under the weather”; “I have felt sick within
the past week”; and “I had a cold or flu recently.” The
average of these four scores was calculated. We note
that in the original study, the interaction between face
type and illness recency on reaction time was
statistically significant (α = .05) when the categorical measure
was used (p = .003) but not when the continuous
measure was used (p = .08). However, the simple effect of
relative attention toward disfigured faces was statistically
significant for analyses using both the categorical and
continuous measures (ps = .001 and .01, respectively,
with relative attention estimated for participants 1 SD
above the mean of the continuous illness-recency
measure). Hence, following
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">Miller and Maner (2011)</xref>
          , we
report outcomes of tests using both categorical and
continuous measures. Given multiple tests of the same
hypothesis, we used an alpha of .025 for both tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants also completed the Perceived
Infectability and Germ Aversion subscales of the Perceived
Vulnerability to Disease (PVD) scale
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(Duncan, Schaller,
&amp; Park, 2009)</xref>
          . As outlined above, we administered other
measures that were not reported by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">Miller and Maner
(2011)</xref>
          . These included the seven pathogen-disgust items

          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">(Tybur, Lieberman,
&amp; Griskevicius, 2009)</xref>
          ; ratings of images connoting
infection risk developed by Curtis, Aunger, and Rabie
(2004); and ratings of the faces used in the dot-probe
task. For these tasks, participants rated items on a 7-point
scale (1 = not at all disgusting, 7 = extremely disgusting).
Finally, participants completed the HEXACO-60
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Ashton
&amp; Lee, 2009)</xref>
          , a measure of the six HEXACO personality
traits. Existing work suggests that perceptions of illness
are partially influenced by personality
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(e.g., Feldman,
Cohen, Doyle, Skoner, &amp; Gwaltney, 1999)</xref>
          . Using the
HEXACO-60 allowed us to test whether the original
results—if replicated—are independent of personality.

        <title>Data-quality checks and data exclusions</title>
        <p>For our primary analysis of the dot-probe task, we
followed the original study by analyzing reaction times only
from trials with correct responses 3 standard deviations
of that participant’s mean reaction time. Participants with
error rates greater than 3 standard deviations from the

We also excluded these participants from the Three

        <p>Other approaches to dot-probe data analysis, although
not utilized in the study being replicated here, are
defensible. We therefore also conducted exploratory analyses
using other approaches (e.g., Winsorizing extreme
responses and using reaction time to congruent trials as
a covariate; see, e.g., McNulty, Meltzer, Makhanova, &amp;</p>
        <p>Maner, 2018). Results from these analyses are reported

        <title>Analyses</title>
        <p>Analysis R code is provided on OSF (https://osf.io/
k2dbf/) and included in the Supplemental Material. We
preregistered two types of analyses to evaluate the
replication. The first tested the null hypothesis that the
interaction between illness recency and face type is
equal to zero. We preregistered our intention to test the
simple effect of face type within the two categories of
illness recency only if the null hypothesis were rejected.
Mean reaction times were analyzed using an analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with face type (disfigured,
nondisfigured) as a within-subjects factor and illness recency
as a between-subjects factor.</p>
        <p>
          Results of replications that test only the null
hypothesis of an effect size equal to zero can be ambiguous.
Wide confidence intervals (CIs) can include both zero
and the effect size found in the original study, and
narrow confidence intervals can fail to overlap with zero
but also be smaller than those included in the 95% CIs
of the original study. To reduce such ambiguity, we also
preregistered our intention to conduct an equivalence
test, which treats the population parameter under the
null hypothesis as a nonzero value. A rejected null
indicates that the population effect size is unlikely to
be equal to or greater than that value
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Lakens, 2017)</xref>
          .
For replication studies,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">Simonsohn (2015)</xref>
          recommends
testing an effect size that an original study had 33%
power to detect. Samples 2.5 times larger than the
original have roughly 80% power to reject population effect
sizes of this magnitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interaction described above is identical to an
independent-samples t test on the differences in
reaction times to the two face types between participants
who had recently been ill and those who had not.
Given that the original study had 28 participants who
had recently been ill and 66 who had not recently been
ill, we set the equivalence bound (dz) to 0.35—the effect
size that the original design afforded 33% power to detect.
Using the two one-sided tests procedure
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Lakens, 2017)</xref>
          ,
we interpreted p values below .05 as indicating that no
meaningful effect exists, and we interpreted p values
of .05 and above as indicating that the effect size (dz)
could indeed be as high as 0.35.
        </p>
        <p>
          We preregistered the same approach as
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">Miller and
Maner (2011)</xref>
          to test whether germ aversion, perceived
infectability, disgust sensitivity, and disgust ratings of
images vary across participants who were and were not
recently ill. These analyses were not reported in Miller
and Maner, but they tested conceptually similar
hypotheses. All analyses were first conducted using the
categorical illness-recency variable and then using continuous
illness-recency variable. Hence, for each test, we used
an alpha of .025 rather than .05.

      <p>On the basis of our preregistered exclusion criteria, we
removed the 9 participants with error rates more than
3 standard deviations above the mean and two
participants who did not complete both the questionnaire and
the dot-probe task, resulting in a final sample of 402
participants, 151 of whom had recently been ill, and
251 of whom had not recently been ill. Alpha
reliabilities were consistent with existing work for
pathogendisgust sensitivity (α = .69), germ aversion (α = .76),
perceived infectability (α = .92), and ratings of
disgusteliciting images (α = .81). Average within-person
response latencies following disfigured faces were
highly correlated with average within-person response
latencies following typical faces, r = .95 (Table 1).</p>
      <p>We observed a main effect of face type: Responses
were slower following disfigured faces (M = 644 ms,
SD = 180) than typical faces (M = 634 ms, SD = 163),
F(1, 400) = 14.96, ηp2 = .036, 90% CI = [.009, .078], p &lt;
.001 (Fig. 1). The main effect of illness recency did not
meet our preregistered threshold (p &lt; .025)—recently
ill: M = 661 ms, SD = 197; not recently ill: M = 626 ms,
SD = 153, F(1, 400) = 4.23, ηp2 = .010, 90% CI = [.000,
.039], p = .040—nor did the interaction between illness
recency and face type (disfigured vs. typical), F(1, 400) =
1.87, ηp2 = .005, 90% CI = [.000, .027], p = .173. Whereas
the original study detected attentional bias toward
disfigured faces only for recently ill participants, we
detected this same attentional bias for participants who
were recently ill (M = 15.71 ms, 95% CI = [4.63, 26.79],
p = .006) and for participants who were not recently ill
(M = 7.51 ms, 95% CI = [1.19, 13.83], p = .02). We also
did not detect an interaction between the continuous
measure of illness recency and attentional biases toward
disfigured relative to typical faces, F(1, 400) = 0.16, ηp2 &lt;
.001, 90% CI = [0.000, 0.013], p = .691, and further, we
did not detect a main effect of the continuous measure
on response latencies, F(1, 400) = 1.06, ηp2 = .003, 90%
CI = [.000, .022], p = .303.</p>
      <p>We were unable to reject the null hypothesis that
illness recency is unrelated to attentional bias toward
disfigured faces. But can we reject the null of the effect
size (dz) being as large as ±0.35—what the original
study had 33% power to detect? Yes—the 90%
confidence intervals of the difference in attentional bias for
participants who were and were not recently ill found
here (dz = −0.14, 90% CI = [−0.31, −0.04]) did not
overlap with an effect size (dz) of −0.35, t(248.4) =
2.01, p = .023, or 0.35, t(248.4) = −4.55, p &lt; .001.</p>
      <p>We next examined relations between illness recency
and the self-report measures. Relying on the categorical
approach, and again using the preregistered critical
p value of .025, we detected a relation between illness
recency and perceived infectability, r = .16, 95% CI =
[.05, .26], p = .006, but not between illness recency and
germ aversion, r = .11, 95% CI = [.01, .22], p = .037;
sensitivity to pathogen disgust, r = .12, 95% CI = [.01,
.23], p = .038; or disgust ratings of the images from the
Curtis data set, r = .05, 95% CI = [−.06, .16], p = .358.
Results were similar using the continuous approach;
we detected a relation between illness recency and
perceived infectability, r = .26, 95% CI = [.17, .35], p &lt;
.001, but not germ aversion, r = .08, 95% CI = [−.02,
.18], p = .127; sensitivity to pathogen disgust, r = .09,
95% CI = [−.00, .19], p = .062; or disgust ratings of
images from the Curtis data set, r = .10, 95% CI = [.00,
.18], p = .047. We also did not detect relations between
illness recency and the six HEXACO factors (all ps &gt;
.07; see the Supplemental Material for full results,
including alternative approaches to analyzing dot-probe
data).</p>

      <p>
        The study replicated here has been interpreted as a key
piece of evidence supporting a relation between
immunological resistance and pathogen avoidance in humans.
Yet given the results from this direct replication, it
should not be taken as evidence for such a relation.
That said, because of two methodological limitations
of the original study and this replication, we hesitate
to interpret our null findings as strong evidence that
pathogen avoidance does not vary as a function of
immunological resistance. First, the dot-probe task has
well-documented psychometric limitations, especially
for the type of between-participant comparisons
reported here
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">(Parsons, Kruijt, &amp; Fox, 2019)</xref>
        . Second,
the degree to which reporting having a head cold in
the last 2 weeks reflects ability to resist pathogens is
unclear. This latter shortcoming is perhaps shared by
other studies that have seemingly demonstrated a
relation between immunological resistance and pathogen
avoidance, in which cocaine dependence

        have been interpreted as markers of a
limited ability to resist pathogens. The use of such approaches
has likely stemmed from the invasiveness and expense of
measuring immune markers. But collaborations with

controlled human-infection trials could allow for
systematic control of the type of pathogen leading to
infection and the time course of infection, as well as pre- and
postinfection observations.</p>
        <p>
          We detected a relation that the original study did
not: Illness recency related to the PVD scale’s Perceived
Infectability subscale. Rather than reflecting a shift in
pathogen avoidance when immunological resistance is
low, though, this relation indicates that reports of recent
illness covary with reports of general illness frequency.
Illness recency was unrelated to the other PVD subscale
(Germ Aversion), disgust sensitivity, and disgust ratings
of images of pathogen threats. Variables that have been
deployed interchangeably to test
behavioral-immunesystem hypotheses
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">(e.g., attentional bias toward disfigured
faces in a dot-probe task, disgust sensitivity, germ
aversion, and perceived infectability; see Tybur, Frankenhuis,
&amp; Pollet, 2014)</xref>
          had correlations (rs) between −.02
(attentional bias and germ aversion) and .60 (disgust
sensitivity and disgust ratings of images). Notably, we
did not detect a relation between attentional bias toward
disfigured faces and disgust sensitivity or germ aversion;
this might suggest that the main effect arose from
lowlevel features of the disfigured faces (e.g., coloration)
rather than from the stimuli being interpreted as
infectious. This research area would benefit from better
developing the validity of the many measures deployed
here. Such an endeavor would match calls to view the
behavioral immune system as just that—a modular
system with distinct components, not all of which can or
should respond identically to something such as
capacity to resist infection

        The existence of modular features of human
psychology dedicated to neutralizing pathogens is not in question
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2 ref27 ref32 ref33 ref5">(e.g., Ackerman et al., 2018; Curtis et al., 2004; Schaller &amp;
Park, 2011; Tybur &amp; Lieberman, 2016)</xref>
        . A key task for
psychologists is understanding the nature of this
psychology and, hopefully, using it to better understand topics
ranging from food choice to intergroup relations to health
decisions, among other things. We hope that this
preregistered direct replication will not be perceived as
repudiating a key hypothesis in this area but rather will facilitate
progress in the substantial and growing literature on the
psychological underpinnings of pathogen avoidance.
