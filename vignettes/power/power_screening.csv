"Nonetheless, subsequent simulation-based power analyses (Kumle et al., 2021) that were not based in any way on our observed data indicated that we had substantial power for detecting very small (d = 0.10) or small (d = 0.20) effects in our primary model for predicting participants' choices (see the Supplemental Material).",method,Design,10,4,1,09567976241249183

"With 500 participants (slightly fewer than in our student sample), power was .97 for a very small effect of ValenceDiff and .81 for a small effect of Frame.",method,Design,10,4,3,09567976241249183

"After reviewing the effect size (Cohen's d = 0.34) of a previous study that used the bias-free b-CFS paradigm to measure conscious access (Litwin et al., 2023), we concluded that a sample of 55 participants was needed for an experimental power of 80% with an alpha level of 0.05 for a planned one-tailed paired-samples t test (power calculation performed in G*Power).",method,Participants,18,1,1,09567976241263344
